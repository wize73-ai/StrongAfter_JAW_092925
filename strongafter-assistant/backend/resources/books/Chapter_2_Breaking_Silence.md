# Chapter 2: Breaking Silence

*"When we are no longer able to change a situation, we are challenged to change ourselves." -Viktor e. Frankl*

For someone with unintegrated trauma, every day may seem the same. Days marked by emotional swings, endless replays, things feeling out of control yet needing to be in control. The feeling of being cut off — avoidance, numbing, and patterns of isolation. Life stuck on repeat. Living in the past. Wishing for a better future. A tenuous connection to the here-and-now.

Today may be the day you start to change that. Don't feel bad that you didn't do it yesterday. Perhaps you just weren't ready then. Perhaps now you are. 

At our clinic, the average age of men seeking recovery from childhood trauma is 45 years old. Given that the average age of childhood sexual abuse for boys is between nine and ten years old, men are often waiting decades before they ask for help. That's a lot of time, much of it in suffering, much of it in silence.

## Breaking Silence

Silence prevents something important: putting words to one's experience. Men who were abused know this all too well. Silence holds the individual in a perpetual state of inanimation — like being frozen in time.

If we get mugged, we call the police. If we have a heart attack, we dial 911. If we lose someone we love, we reach out for sympathy and support.

Yet men who have been wounded often remain silent. Perhaps you, too.

There are many reasons for this silence, from masculine identity (see Chapter 3), to social norms (see Chapter 5), and one's physiology (see Chapter 6). Even in the immediacy of the abuse or assault, silence often results from: 

### Reasons for the Silence
**Messages from yourself:**
 - embarrassment, guilt and shame
 - I deserved this
 - guys are supposed to be invulnerable
 - a (misplaced) sense of responsibility
 - I should have been able to fight them off
 - no one will believe me
 - people will think I am gay
 - people will think I wanted it 
 - my family will be hurt

**Messages from yourself abuser(s):**
 - you will get in trouble
 - I'll tell them that you're gay
 - it will pull the family apart
 - they will throw us in jail
 - you wanted this you took my gifts/money
 - you could have said no
 - I'll kill your family/friends/ pets
 - I'll kill you

Silence is demanded by abusers, and often embraced by victims. Keeping the abuse secret serves both parties for different reasons. For the abuser, it keeps their crimes hidden — often allowing a continued pattern of offending while avoiding any recrimination or consequences. For those abused, the silence is often part of the shame response (see Chapter 11 for why shame is considered the "master" emotion). The need for silence is an unspoken bond (or understanding) between the two — silence being essential for the perpetrator and the only option for the victim. 

To move on with your life, words need to be put to the experience. As your voice has been the second casualty of abuse, your task is to break this silence. This is not just your story. This is your life, and it needs to be restored with truth telling.

## Putting Words To It

You may have lived with your experience for many years before putting words to it or seeking help. Likely, those years of silence were a private hell — your own suffering.

Some men "stumble" into recovery, challenged by external events in their lives, such as:

 - hearing a disclosure of abuse from a friend or family member that triggers old memories
seeing the person(s) who offended them
 - having children of their own, particularly a child the same age they were when they were abused
 - experiencing a crisis in their relationship whereby their partner insists on them seeking counselling
 - mourning a relationship breakdown
 - receiving a direct question about past trauma from a helping professional or friend
 - public events, public figures or media stories that focus on childhood trauma 

Men may also seek help upon:

 - recognizing their current ways of coping aren't working well anymore
 - wrestling with alcohol or drugs, only to realize there was a reason for drinking and drugging to begin with
 - getting too close to notions of suicide
 - losing inordinate amounts of time, energy and money by seeking escape in compulsive activities
 - realizing they are pushing cherished people away (when they want the opposite)
 - engaging in behaviours that threaten their well-being, both psychologically and physically (i.e., risky behaviours)
 - realizing they are not the person they were meant to be — or want to be 

Now here's the rub. We were all vulnerable as children. All chil-dren are. And the men who were abused were harmed by people, usually people in a position of trust. This is vastly different from being a victim of a hurricane or a car crash. At its core, childhood abuse is an act of betrayal.

In many respects, it makes "good sense" that many survivors are wary of trusting others — be it a new neighbour, a potential friend, a possible date — given this history. Fundamentally, if a man concludes that *people = trust = betrayal = suffering*, he will shun connection with anyone who wants to get close to him.

This is bound to cause problems because people are wired for connection. We are social beings. We are pack animals. For 99% of our time on this planet, we have eked out our existence by living in small bands, organizing ourselves to eat each day and not be eaten. We had to learn skills from each other, adapt to the norms of the group, arrange safety and protection, and get our needs met. This is how we survived as a species. This is who we are and how we are bound together. 

While someone may "instinctively" stay clear of other people as a reaction to betrayal, this isolation prevents healing because it is the very connection with others that is the ticket to recovery.

We talk about this extensively in our therapy groups. One example comes to mind. For instance, if you read all the self-help books in the world staying in an enclosed room, would you find healing? You would know a lot more, and you could say you were more prepared to take on the work ahead, but you would not experience substantive recovery.

You *cannot* heal in isolation. You cannot be your "true self" in isolation either. Even though you were hurt by other people, the only way to recover is being in relation with others. 

Somewhere in your recovery, you need to connect with others. It will be essential to your well-being. It may be a therapist, your best friend, and/or being in a group of like-minded people. 

Still, how do you know who to trust? It may be important to make this clear to yourself before you start to open up or tell your story. For example, think through folks you know who can:

 - validate your feelings
 - hold space for you to share at your own pace
 - believe you
 - keep your story private
 - provide you with emotional support
 - deliver on their promises
 - listen without offering unsolicited advice

Active listening, empathy and understanding, being supportive and reflective are all aspects of holding space for one another. Once you choose who can hold space for your story, you are no longer alone on your journey to recovery. 

You may note a friction in the work ahead: silence and isolation have been essential to managing your pain, but articulating your experience and finding social bonds are now going to prove essential on your path to recovery. This is one of the many paradoxes required for trauma recovery. We will explore that in a bit.

## Emotional Literacy

All skills require practice. Men in therapy are no exception. Twice a meeting, men in our trauma recovery groups practise deepening their emotional expression:

*"Let's hear from everyone in our opening (closing) round and 'check-in.' In a few words, tell us how you are feeling right now, at this very moment (e.g. glad, sad, mad, anxious, calm, etc.). Feelings more than thoughts."*

This instruction rails against the ingrained principle of responding to "How are you?" with a facile, socially accepted reply like, "I'm good." Yet, it is on this deeper, more profound level that we must start building emotional literacy. The work of expressing emotional vulnerability is essential — a form of truth-telling you can start practising in your day-to-day life. 

Let's start with understanding the role of emotions:

 - An emotion is a physiological response to a stimulus, event or thought. It is invisible.
 - Sometimes we need to distinguish between emotions and the closely inferred subjectivity of their experience that we can label as "feelings."
 - Emotions interface between body-based knowing and our minds.
 - How one labels their emotions influences how they respond to a situation. 
 - Some emotions are not easily identified, perhaps nameless. Some languages contain emotional labels that have no parallel in English.
 - Emotions are not discrete. They may not be understood even if they are felt. Sometimes a range of emotions can be felt, even contradictory ones at the same time. 
 - At times, one emotion may mask another. 
 - The struggle to identify feelings may be a limiting experience for some.
 - Emotions are not facts.
 - There are no right or wrong emotions. Still, the experience of processing the feeling state may be difficult, or judged as "negative."
 - "Good," "okay" and "bad" are not emotions — they are judgements or evaluations of one's feeling state. 

While everyone varies in their ability to detect, name and express emotions, males seem to hold a more limited repertoire of emotional literacy. Chapter 3 will explore this connection between masculinity and emotional constriction further — the throttling of one's emotional expression due to gender coding. 

In our group work, men are reminded that emotional reflection is what counts, rather than sharing their thoughts or responding in a superficial manner. Surface responses don't tell us anything meaningful, nor help you gain insight. Given that men historically haven't been encouraged to be emotionally expressive, superficiality is not that surprising. They are often brought up instead to be the silent ones. 

No doubt there are times when you don't know what you feel or you can't articulate the feeling. When this occurs, take the time you need. Even an experience of emotional "neutrality" can be explored. It may feel like waking up from a nap. If it fits, "calm" might be a good label for your feelings (or thoughtful, relaxed, content, etc.).

Yet, being neutral may also be akin to being cut off from your feelings. In those cases, you could say you are feeling "numb" (or emotionless, disoriented, dissociated, etc.). The target is emotional clarity.

This is in part the purpose of emotional expression — it brings others closer. There is a certain sweetness when two people can give and receive this invitation to connect. In doing so, you can allow yourself to enter this "truer" aspect of relationship — and get some accompaniment on your journey as well. 

## The Principle Of Asking For What You Want

Aside from learning to identify one's feelings and expressing them openly, another aspect of emotional connection is learning to ask for what you want in an assertive manner. This is a skill that needs to be practised repeatedly, like any ability. This section will provide some practical tips on how to communicate with greater awareness, ability and integrity — something men and trauma survivors often have trouble doing.  

Many men have ingrained patterns of communication in which their real needs are often unmet in relationships. In part, this is due to stoicism and self-sacrifice — endemic traits in modern masculinity (themes that will be explored in the next chapter). Survivors of trauma often protect themselves against vulnerability and connection as well. Their personal needs  often have been overridden by other people's needs, which creates confusion, conflict avoidance and/or an unwillingness to allow for vulnerability with others, resulting in a no-win situation for all. 

That said, trouble may follow whenever the individual focuses solely on his own needs (which may be interpreted as aggressive), ignoring his own needs (being passive), or ignoring the needs of both (creating a passive-aggressive dynamic). These patterns could prove harmful to his relationships, including how he generally interacts with everyone — in sum, his relational self. Many men need to be reminded about the strength and clarity of assertiveness, whereby both one's own needs and the other person's needs can be respected. 

The principle of assertiveness can help you to stand up for your rights and needs while respecting the rights and needs of others. Responsible assertiveness involves:

 - letting one's wants and needs be known without necessarily expecting others to change
 - taking personal responsibility while getting one's own needs met
 - being responsible for one's thoughts, feelings and behaviours using "I" statements 
 - not demanding that others agree 
 - being willing to compromise
 - accepting others for who they are 
 - challenging the behaviour of others when their behaviour violates one's rights 

### Assertive Communication

It can be helpful to follow these four steps during a conflict:

*Example:* 
1.  I felt disappointed. 
2. When you failed to follow through on what you said you would do.
3. In the future, I want you to commit to promises you make to me.
4. So I can consider you a trusting friend. 

*Your Situation*
1. I feel/felt (fill in the blank)
2. When you did (fill in the blank)
3. In the future I would like (fill in the blank) to occur.
4. So that I can feel/be (fill in the blank) with you.

Responsible assertiveness allows you to integrate your emotions with intentions, facilitating greater self-worth and more positive outcomes:

 - Feelings: confidence, self-respect, good self-esteem
 - Intentions: mutual understanding and respect
 - Outcomes: healthy relationships, respect, trust and emotional intimacy

This will get you closer to the sweet spot — the optimal possible outcome in your relationships. And while assertiveness doesn't guarantee you will get the outcome you want, it's the best bet for success.

## The Principle Of "Fighting Fairly"

Even in relationships that value the notion of responsible assertiveness, disagreement and conflicts will still occur. With past abuse, many men tend to avoid conflict as it may spark memories of past pain. Other men may rely on conflict to get what they want. Given the need to hold yourself respectfully in situations of conflict, you may need to remind yourself that you can proceed in ways that are respectful to yourself, to other(s) and to the relationship as a whole. Consider the following best practices around fair fighting:

### Fighting Fairly

*Identify the problem and express your feelings:*
e.g., "I get frustrated when you are late."

*Focus on the problem itself:*
e.g., "What would be helpful for you to be on time?"

*Attack the problem, not the person:*
e.g., Don't say, "You're late because you don't care." Instead, ask: "What can we do differently to prevent me from waiting for you to show up?"

*Listen to the other person with an open mind and make your request:* 
e.g., "I realize the traffic was heavy, but next time call me."

*Treat the other person's feelings with respect:*
e.g., "I see you are embarrassed right now. I know you wanted to be on time."

*Take responsibility for your own actions and set consequences as need be:*
e.g., "If you're late next time, I will go straight to the movie and meet you there."

## The Principle Of Emotional Integrity

While emotional expression is important, it needs to be taken one step further. We call this deepening of relationships *Emotional Integrity (EI)*. While there are many definitions of the notion of integrity, EI focuses on matters of the heart — how we carry ourselves with "significant "(or important) people in our life.

A simple way of understanding EI is this: matching our thoughts with our feelings and behaviours. The notion is to ensure that one "walks the talk." While this is helpful, it doesn't tell us how to get there. For that, we need to dig into EI in a deeper, more profound way.

Think of EI as putting emotional intelligence into action. It requires a three-step process, and for it to pay off, it must proceed in the order outlined: 

**Step #1: Be honest with yourself.** Easy to say, but not to do. Profound honesty. Keep in mind that many people wear blinders as to who they are, oblivious to their inner process, or how they come across to others. Radical self-acceptance is needed, much like seeing your entire image in a mirror and not turning away. As no one can judge if you are doing this yourself, you must be the final arbitrator of honesty. Fundamentally though, you cannot make any changes in your life (think trauma recovery) without succeeding in this first and primary step. Nothing in life can be achieved by shielding one's eyes.

**Step #2:** Take responsibility for your feelings and behaviours. Again, easy to say, yet difficult to do. Even if you don't know what you are feeling, you have to own your behaviours and not blame them on your past, other people, etc. No longer can you say, "she pushed my buttons" or "I just flipped out" — nothing but full responsibility must be taken. 

Taking ownership for one's *behaviour* is relatively straight-forward — a lesson taught in childhood but requiring regular reminders in adulthood. Ownership of *feelings* may necessitate "unpacking." Naming an emotion and acknowledging it as yours requires deep self-conscious reflection. Naming it allows you to take full responsibility to make whatever changes you wish to act on. 

Try to practise EI. Express how you are feeling (e.g., glad, sad, mad, scared, ashamed, etc.) without attributing external causes upon anything or anybody. No longer does your partner "make" you angry — the emotional state called "anger" stems from within you. Increasing your EI allows you to be more responsible and responsive. The people in your life will be able to understand both you and your inner process — core elements of maintaining and holding connection. 

The goal is to practise *emotional granularity* — finding the precise language to communicate your felt states with others. Just like grains of sand, see if you can identify and articulate each feeling as it comes up. This is essential in *Step #1* (being honest with ourselves) as well as *Step #2* (being responsible for our behaviours and feeling states) and leads to *Step #3* (getting closer to others). 

*Step #1* and *Step #2* are the stuff of most therapy. They are critical skills in terms of living an authentic life. Suffice to say while Steps #1 and #2 are useful, they are not sufficient. This brings us to the third step.

To carry out this last step, you will need to identify who is "significant" in your life. Deep trusting relationships, folks you would catch a bullet for, your true loved ones. Make a list now — who is on your list?

Your list could be two or 20 names long — the actual number doesn't matter, but it is essential that you know who is on this list (and just as important, who is not!).

You are now ready to move to Step #3 — the most difficult of the steps:

**Step #3: Close the emotional space between you and trusted others.**
We are not talking about physical space — we are talking about becoming honest and vulnerable with these folks in your life, opening up to them, and not fearing emotional intimacy.

Emotional intimacy is not about physical or sexual intimacy. Don't be put off by this word. Many men struggle with the thought of telling their family or friends about their past abuse. Without taking this third step, they would continue to live in isolation. Choosing emotional intimacy opens up the potential of untold riches in understanding, support, and expressions of love. 

While it may be challenging for folks of all genders, this third step is no doubt harder for men due to conventional masculine codes of behaviour that keep them distant from others (see Chapter 3 on how masculinity impacts our connection with others). 

EI may be especially hard for many survivors due to problems in developing trusting relationships with others. 

In this work of establishing deeper connection with others, you may witness a transformation within yourself concerning not only how you assert your interpersonal boundaries, but also with the rigidity of any masculine traits that limit how you hold space with others.  

You are now in a position to map where you are in terms of these stages. With each relationship of significance, you can assess how far you have gone in achieving *Step #3*. With this insight, you can now consider what you can do next to close the gap and thus heighten connection and intimacy.

That is the deep work of EI — nurturing one's life and relationships to develop "genuine" connection with others. 

## Learning Through Paradox

In the novel *Catch 22*, author Joseph Heller describes the situation of a pilot in World War II seeking to be declared insane to avoid combat, given the risk of dying. However, his psychiatrist deemed him not to be insane as the pilot wanted to avoid danger — a rational desire. Indeed, the pilot, because of his sanity, had to fly more missions.

A paradox involves a situation or statement that is seemingly impossible to understand because it posits two opposing propositions. While they may be overlooked in everyday life (e.g., being turned down for a car loan because you don't have enough money, but knowing you could get the loan if you had the money), the role of paradox is critical to understanding and navigating trauma and recovery.

Often, when one is faced with a contradictory message, the reaction may be similar to being immobilized. Think of approaching an intersection with the traffic lights showing a red and green light. One needs to see through the contradiction, recognize both of its messages, then proceed with this greater understanding. Without this analysis, the result could be one of being stuck or frozen.

Has your belief in any of the following paradoxical statements been a barrier in your healing?

 - As I never acknowledged the abuse, I don't need to deal with it.
 - I was hurt because I was vulnerable; therefore, I must avoid being vulnerable.
 - As many feelings are difficult and painful, I need to avoid them.
 - As I was hurt by others, isolating myself ensures my safety. Strength only lies within myself.
 - I value my personal comfort. Given that, I don't want to engage in any process that will make me feel uncomfortable.
 - To live the life I want, I require things to be "under control." Out of fear of the unknown, I don't want to take risks.

Yet, paradoxical thinking can also lead you to healing. Consider the following statements as guides to your recovery:

 - You gain more control over your life by learning to let go of control.
 - True strength comes from admitting you are vulnerable.
 - You move forward by learning to sit with the past.
 - Courage is not the absence of fear but moving forward regardless

Despite your best efforts, *you can't think your way to trauma recovery*. It is not a linear process that can be intellectualized. Instead of escaping the pain of your body, mind and soul, you need to lean into the pain in a manageable way, not avoid it (see Chapter 9 for how this can be done). 

Growth isn't always linear; it is messy. Despite discomfort and set-backs, it has to be faced with courage. *You have to get in to get out.* This is arguably the greatest paradox to embrace on the healing journey. 

## Embracing Self-Compassion

No one can be successful in recovery work without practising self-compassion. Self-compassion is a way of accepting yourself with kindness and concern. Regardless of your "performance" — good days and bad, strengths and weaknesses, the task is to accept your "perfectly imperfect" self.

Almost universally, this kindness to the self fails to exist in the daily lives of many men. While later chapters will explore how to rebuild compassion for oneself, for now it just needs to be recognized.

1. *Self-kindness (vs. self-judgement):* Being warm and understanding towards yourself with regard to suffering and pain.
2. *A sense of shared humanity (vs. isolation):* Recognizing that suffering and personal inadequacy is part of the human experience.
3. *Balance (vs. over-identification):* Accepting all emotions, while avoiding suppressing or exaggerating them.

## Finding Allies On Your Journey

By now you understand that trauma recovery is no picnic. Instead, it's long haul work, fraught with complexities. Often, it must address years, if not decades, of avoidance, let alone curb or replace problematic coping mechanisms. No one can guide themselves to this place of recovery as they have never been there before. Guides are an essential part of the journey.

Here is where a counsellor or therapist comes into play. While they are not the only helping relationship you may employ, their role may be critical for your recovery. They may be essential in your task of acknowledging your truth, hearing your story, and helping you acquire self-compassion. This is quite the responsibility. This level of support may be beyond what a loved one can provide. It often takes a concerned, trained and empathic "outsider" to help you chart your way.

If you are new to the healing process, consider finding a therapist to accompany you on this journey. Apart from learning skills and awareness of what it takes to recover from past abuse, your therapist can inject elements of trust, hope, safety and security. You no longer have to travel alone. 

As the therapeutic relationship deepens over time, you may experience a deep emotional connection. This connection is restorative (a type of repair work), for you to feel unconditional regard, trust and safety — and will help undo some of the harm of the unsafe relationships you experienced when you were abused.  

When you are shopping for a therapist, you may want to consider interviewing prospective helpers to see who can work best with you. You have the right to ask them about their experience, qualifications and approaches to working with the issues. You may also want to consider the following:

### Tips for Shopping for a Therapist:

1. Just having credentials does not mean they have specific training or competency in *trauma* recovery. You will need to ask them. 

2. Experience working with women does not necessarily translate into the same abilities *working with men*. Ask them about their knowledge, comfort and experience working with male clients. Don't overlook this aspect of care. 

3. Given the longer-term nature of trauma therapy, you need to determine whether the cost is *affordable*. Some therapists and agencies offer sliding fee scales depending on the client's income. Group therapy is also an option as it is more economical than individual therapy. 

4. Having a therapist with whom you feel comfortable, heard and who can challenge you is also key. You may also prefer one gender or another. Its important to find the right *click.*

Here is another angle to consider: group therapy. Being in a group of other folks working on recovery, particularly men, may be helpful. You may learn as much from your "fellow travellers" as from the group therapist (often called a *facilitator*). You will meet other people who are dealing with similar problems, share ideas, as well as exchange emotional support. 

Group work may focus on skills training, emotional processing, or a balance of both. The facilitator takes on the role not only of therapist, but also teacher. They further hold responsibility for the climate of the group: when to dig deeper, when to shift focus, when to engage other individuals to ensure that "talk time" is shared and respectful. Almost all groups have guidelines around conduct. It is the therapist's job (not the group members) to ensure the group maintains safety and trust for all. 

Group work provides connection with others. In many ways, it is like a laboratory to try out new awarenesses, share experiences that may be unvoiced, practise new skills of expression, vulnerability and allow for normalizing — no longer seeing oneself as the only one who went through a particular experience. By con-tributing their stories, participants will view their experiences differently.

Group therapy has been referred to as "Triple E" treatment: it is *equivalent* to the experience of individual therapy; it is seen as clinically *effective*, and lastly it is more *economical* than individual work.

The ideal arrangement is to consider both individual and group work concurrently as it will allow you to heal in different ways. Think of therapy as being analogous to the needs of trees. Tree roots require *depth* for sustenance — they need to go deep. This is the role of individual therapy. That therapy hour is just for you and is about you. Yet, tree roots also need to have *breadth* for stability, resourcing, and interconnection with other living things. That is the role for groups in all of its forms: facilitator-led therapy groups, peer-support groups (in which there is a group leader with the same lived experience), online support groups, and peer discussion boards. All allow for interactivity and mutual support.

Allies in your healing are necessary. You can't do this work alone. 

## Chapter 2 Reflections

1. Review the following key concepts introduced in this chapter, and if appropriate, note any reflections or examples that come to mind on the following: *holding space, "true" emotional expression, assertiveness, "fighting fairly," emotional integrity, emotional granularity, relationships of significance, the three causalities of trauma (i.e., truth, voice, self-compassion), finding allies.*
2. What were the messages you told yourself about the abuse? 
3. What kept you silent about the abuse? You may wish to reflect on how old you were when you disclosed the abuse. What did you do to break this silence? Who did you tell? What were the qualities of this connection that allowed you to disclose eventually? If you haven't told anyone about the abuse, what might be holding you back from doing so?

## Fellow Traveller Quotes

*I never could talk about it in the past. Instead, I would keep it a secret, or tear up when I saw an intervention on a TV show. Now I know I wasn't facing my past. Now that I can talk about it more comfortably, I believe healing is happening now.*

*always seem to say things like "what happened to me" or "the stuff I went through." I have a really hard time with the terminology. Back then he called it "playing around." That's why it seemed, on some level, acceptable.*

*The first person I told was my mom and she just kept saying,  "it wasn't your fault." That was a tremendous start to recovery.*

*It's as if I stopped trusting my own perceptions, doubted my own feelings and experiences. That I "took it personally" vs. seeing it for the abuse it was.*

*I always want to be tough but inside when I feel and talk about my trauma, it's like I'm 13 all over again and scared.*

*Whenever my father would beat me, I knew that it would not end until I was a spineless mush. Showing emotions of any kind was asking for trouble. Crying would make him angry, "What are you? Some kind of stupid baby?"*

*Sometimes I wish I would just wake up one morning and say, "I'm fine." I have spent much of my life waking up and wishing I wasn't alive.*
