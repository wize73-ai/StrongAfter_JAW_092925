# Chapter 3: On Men & Masculinity

*"But the pressure for men to minimize pain eclipses their desire for help."-Terry real*

hink back to a time when you experienced loss: a breakup, the ending of a friendship, the death of someone close to you. How did you express your hurt? Did you act in ways that could be described as:

* expressionless?
* acting tough?
* unperturbed? 
* angry?

These emotional reactions were likely shaped by your masculinity. While our emotional world is vast and open in possibility, gender expectations and conditioning constrict both men's inner awareness as well as their outer expression. If men can ascertain how their notions of masculinity affect them, this may create an opening to living more fully. 

Vulnerability requires being emotionally present, understanding that there is purpose in emotions, and that the sharing of emotions is integral to interpersonal well-being and healing. Society has constructed masculine norms and values, which constrain men's emotional experience, in particular for male survivors. 

The expectations about gender shape us deeply — from birth throughout our lives. For boys and men, society has developed norms and expectations regarding their: 

* actions and behaviours
* appearance and bodies
* the type of jobs they should have
* the ways in which they engage in romance and sex 
* and critically, the feelings they may show

How do these codified expectations about masculinity play a role in: 

* your experience of abuse? 
* your ability to share your story?
* your ability to ask for help? 
* your current work on recovery? 

## The Big Impossible

One of the first critical explorations of masculinity was called *The Male Code*. This code reflects how mainstream society thinks men should be. These notions of masculinity are socially bound and are powerful in how men's thoughts, feelings, and behaviours are seemingly governed.

The Male Code encompasses four separate, yet intertwined, notions or *value sets*. For the sake of clarity, I will divide the fourth code into two sub-sections.

### #1: The Rugged Individual

Men should be emotionally stoic (unmoved by emotion) and hide their inner lives. They should be tough and deny their pain ("suck it up"). They should be independent and self-reliant.

However, the evidence suggests that this internalization is a vulnerability on many levels. For example, if men as a gender are so tough, rough and independent, one might wonder why men, more than women, tend to drink and drug more, let alone die from overdoses. Men also have higher mortality rates from suicide (3-4x more), homicide, war, dangerous occupations (e.g., police, firefighting), workplace accidents (e.g., construction, mining, logging, fishing), road traffic accidents, extreme sports and drowning.

### #2: The Big Man

Men should be preoccupied with work, status, money, muscularity, and achievement. They should aspire to be number one, the boss. They should be competent and never fail. They should have "power over" others, especially over women. They should be sexually powerful. They should not be victims.

The perks of power are many, including material comfort and greater selection of sexual partners. However, the downside is that most men are left behind. They may feel "less than" because they compare themselves to an unattainable ideal. A chronic sense of failure is often the result, accompanied by harsh self-talk that may be unrelenting.

### #3: Give'em Hell

Men should be forceful and aggressive with others, particularly with other men. They should see life as a battlefield. They should be competitive and fearless. "Winning isn't the main thing, it's the only thing."

This notion also has its costs particularly with regard to violence. While men inflict more injuries on others than women, they are also the majority of victims of homicide, assault and robbery. Many men lose aspects of compassion, empathy and being "other-oriented," particularly in times of stress and perceived conflict. Overall, men are more likely to be diagnosed with being anti-social and narcissistic. Men fill our jails.

Next are the codes that were originally referred to as "no sissy stuff," as they pertain to gender role division and sexual orientation. Here, conventional masculinity shows oppositional identity and expression in two directions: to femininity and to queerness.

### #4: The Rejection of the Perception of Femininity

According to the gender dictates of Western culture, men should reject everything associated with femininity, including being vulnerable, emotional, nurturing, and expressing non-sexual intimacy. Sex should be understood as purely a physical act, not an emotional, relational or spiritual one.

The Male Code demands that any feminine qualities held by the male must be *rejected*, then *projected* onto the "other" — the other being women — the only rightful recipients of these qualities. This often leads to disdain and judgement, with women being seen as "less than," "weaker than" or "softer than." One can ponder how this aspect of conventional masculinity contributes to the creation and maintenance of *misogyny* — in other words, contempt or hatred of females. 

Shedding the softer side of human expression leaves men constricted and diminished as a result. For example, receiving the message that "boys don't cry" in one's early years can create an unwelcome legacy for men who are left unable to express their pain decades later.

### #5: The Rejection of the Perception of Homosexuality

There is a parallel notion with respect to homosexuality. The Male Code expects men to be straight; this coding dictates that men should reject homosexuality or any qualities that could be seen as "gay" or held more broadly in queer communities.

In essence, the male-identified person not only has to be outwardly masculine (and not feminine) but outwardly heterosexual as well. Men need to reject any qualities within themselves that could be seen as queer (e.g., being creative, "effeminate" in expression, certain stereotypic occupations). Projection comes next: only "gay guys" do that, not "real men." The end result may involve scorn and shaming — active discrimination against folks who are not "truly" men, creating the bedrock of *homophobia* (the contempt or hatred of queer people). 

There is not much allowance for individuation and self-expression in all of this, is there? Conventional masculinity suggests a stripping down of men's humanness, a constriction of the men we were meant to be and a sense that masculinity means invulnerability.

These various aspects of the Male Code may influence your understanding about emotional disclosure, your expression of pain, and your ability to ask for help. Not surprisingly, adherence to some of these codes correlates to poorer mental and physical health outcomes for men, greater danger of being a victim of violence and premature death.

The Male Code harms men in many ways, including limiting emotional expression, taking undue physical risks, overly relying on one's work identity — all to the detriment of personal well-being as well as family and community involvement.

Fortunately, in recent times, there's been a shift away from the rigidity of the Male Code, in part fueled by feminism, popular culture, and the rise and broader acceptance of the queer community. Still, this social progression is not uniformly witnessed across society, with many men still set in traditional and harmful ways. The rise of social commentary from ideologues encouraging a return to rigid gender roles has not helped. The growth of the "incel movement" — the online subculture of men who claims injustice due to their lack of romantic or sexual success is another troubling sign of women-hating. And on the school yard, the name-calling of boys still tends to be labels of girl, pussy, sissy, and fag. 
 
It is heartening that more and more men are questioning the masculine norms they grow up with. Many men are taking on egalitarian values, a softening of set roles, more room for self-expression, greater en-gagement in their emo-tional lives, and, in particular, greater father involvement. These changes may come at some cost for individual men as they reject what is expected of them. Still, the shadow of traditional masculinity looms over many men's psyches. Men who have been wounded are no exception. 

The Male Code has been called The Big Impossible of masculinity in that virtually all men "fail" to meet its requirements. And failure begets shame and a variety of compensatory coping mechanisms (including hyper-masculinity), which invariably compound tragic outcomes in their lives. Although many would not admit to it, men suffer. 

## Invulnerability As A Given

If the Male Code was distilled into one word, it would be *invulnerable*. Of course, invulnerable people (of whatever gender) cannot, by definition, be victimized. So, when a male is victimized, he faces an impossible position — identify with masculinity (and thus deny the victimization occurred) or acknowledge the harm done and face the perceived failure of not living up to the Male Code. In either case, the outcome is often unrelenting pain.  
 
The Male Code shapes trauma expression in ways that can be seen as conforming to its dictates: anger and rage, as well as qualities of reserve and stoicism. Indeed, the masculine ideal is self-reliance, which, as we will see in the next chapter, also happens to be a core trauma expression. 

## Gender Role Strain

Subscribing to the Male Code causes pain and suffering for many men — this is known as *Gender Role Strain*. 

Gender Role Strain is the cost of holding onto these internalized social dictates. It is the painful "underbelly" in men's lives throughout their lifespan. While all men, to various degrees, experience this vulnerability, Gender Role Strain facilitates inadequacy, often leaving men feeling empty in unfulfilling roles with weighty consequences. 

There are three components to Gender Role Strain:

**Discrepancy Strain:** Discrepancy strain re-sults from not living up to your internalized ideal of being a man as it is nearly impossible to achieve. You conclude that you are not good enough, not powerful enough, not good-looking enough, not rich enough, etc. Many men "fail" in this measure of a man, and the consequence is shame — the most painful of all emotions.

**Trauma Strain:** There are many painful "rituals" that boys and male youth go through as they learn to become men. Hazing and being bullied or humiliated by peers are often "rites of passage." From making the team to going through frosh week to joining the military, hazing affects many men's lives, often in harmful ways, leaving them feeling wounded, inadequate, or injured. The consequences of Trauma Strain can be severe, from alcohol poisoning, to physical assault, to suicide, even death. 

**Dysfunction Strain:** This strain takes its toll when men follow traditional patterns of being a man that seem "dysfunctional" in retrospect. A man can experience negative consequences by conforming to a given script, which is often role-modelled by father figures or results from social pressures. Behaviour related to Dysfunction Strain often culminates in crises and consequences that may include violence. 

For example, if you were brought up with a domineering father, you may tend to replicate this behaviour when you have a family. If your father  was controlling, abusive or assaultive, you may have inter-nalized this conduct (consciously or not) as part of an accepted code of behaviour for men. If this has been your experience, one day you may find the police at your door for assaulting someone you love.

In a different situation, Dysfunction Strain shows in the role of being a provider. A man may believe that as a husband or father he must not only put bread on the table, but must provide his family with shiny things — possibly things he never had when he was growing up. He may believe that being a good provider is paramount. By holding such a value, he may end up working so much that his relationships with his loved ones suffer. One day, he may find that his partner or children walk out on him as he has become a "workaholic" and neglected his family.

Other consequences of Dysfunction Strain include: sexual compulsions, substance abuse, high-risk behaviour, absentee fathering, failure to share the "emotional work" in relationships, health problems and proneness to sexual coercion and aggression. 

These three strains produce wounds that are often overlooked by society, and may go unrecognized by the individual male as it is seen as something to be expected. The cost of living with these strains is significant and includes relational discord, absent or poor fathering, risky behaviours and aggression. 

Arguably all men, to various degrees, experience the painful shadow of masculinity. This state is not dependent of childhood abuse; rather, this is the lived reality of men in general. It's as if masculinity facilitates inadequacy, leaving many feeling empty in unfulfilling roles with consequences that may hold a similar weight like past abuse. Men may end up hurt and stifled and may cause the same pain for those around them. 

## The Social Construction Of Masculinity 

Masculinity is often measured by performance, an achievement that has only short-term effects. The "big man," the top athlete, the rich guy, the player, the bully — must display their masculinity on a regular basis or they will lose their relative power. "Men got to do, if men want to be."

There is no need to discuss anatomical sex in examining how masculinity impacts men's lives as that has little to do with the social formulation of being men. Like the imperatives of conventional masculinity expression of non-femininity and compulsive heterosexuality, the projection of the male identity is both constructed and complex. 

The male-identified self invariably interacts with other identities — racial and cultural identities, sexual orientation, and socio-economic class, among others. One can conclude that there are many, many masculinities after all, yet they all exist within the shadow of the dominant cultural expression of the Male Code. This results in how ideals of masculinity are celebrated in society (vs. traits that are ridiculed, or left unseen) and how men are supposed to act under this weight.  

There are male-identified folks who exist outside the binary of conventional masculinity — those who "failed" that definition. Some individuals actively reject these social conventions, challenging any gendered classification whatsoever, expressing their identities as being far outside these standards. Some live as true sexual "outlaws," shunning many of the prescribed roles or lifestyles associated with masculinity. Other men take on gradual shifts in their self-definition of masculinity and slowly embrace, over time, the type of men they want to be. 

Transforming one's gender and sexual identities does not occur without cost or great effort, yet may allow for an honest and authentic expression of one's self. In many ways, these outliers to the Male Code may serve as role models to the rest of us in that they have paid the price, and borne the rewards, of living a life where they have defined themselves on their own terms.  

As a caveat, this is not to shame men for internalizing the Male Code. Some of these qualities have debatably served their purposes for men (and their societies over the millennium). For example, in certain contexts, they are arguably helpful (e.g., hunting, fighting fires, defending one's country from invaders). These qualities have been taken on for a reason, so its not all black-and-white. That said, we need to shed light on how the Male Code can inadvertently stymie men seeking recovery. Note that aspects of the Male Code also subjugate others (e.g., women, gay men, those who seemingly don't conform to its standards) and thus need to be challenged lest it continue to cause harm.  It is, yet again, another paradox to contemplate. 

It is beyond the scope of this book to go further in depth on the Male Code. However, some studies have inferred a correlation between poor health outcomes and how certain values of the Male Code are held. In particular, both the Rugged Individual and Give'em Hell with their emphasis on risk-taking, isolation and proneness to violence suggests that adherence to these values results in men's higher rates of mortality. 

## Emotional Compression

Studies have shown that women have greater emotional awareness and a larger emotional lexicon than men. Researchers are unsure as to the reasons for this difference — a matter of brain wiring or socialization or both. Whereas femininity connotes being in relationship with others, masculinity suggests individualism and invulnerability. 

Men tend to display less emotional depth in communication, perhaps relying on women to do more of the "emotional work." The advent of boys' puberty marks the beginning of constricted emotional expression between male friends. Overall, males' emotional and social richness tends to atrophy. Their range of emotional granularity (i.e., precise emotional articulation) also diminishes. 

Before proceeding, let's continue to explore why we have emotions in the first place. Emotions serve as an "early warning system" — a way of protecting oneself physically (fear in the face of danger), interpersonally (anger reflecting a violation of boundaries) as well as strengthening emotional intimacy (guilt signals a breach of connection with others). With every emotion, there is a powerful feedback loop to ourselves and others. 

*Affective numbing* describes a lack of emotional awareness and expression for many men who experienced abuse as a child. It is a symptom of trauma and manifests as an inability to sense or speak about one's emotions. Affective numbing constrains many men, not only those who have been abused. 

*Alexithymia* is similar. Individuals with alexithymia experience emotions but have a hard time naming and expressing them. Instead, when asked about their emotions, they may describe physical symptoms or relay the events of their day instead. A somewhat  related concept is *anhedonia* — the inability to feel pleasure. While these conditions may not be directly related to a trauma response, they are experiences found most often in men.

Consider all the above now: the relentless standards of The Big Impossible (think invul-nerability), the painful legacy of the Gender Role Strain, the harsh gatekeeping of gender role standards, and the parched desert of men's emotionality. This leaves men with two consequences to wrestle with: the pull of grandiosity and the push of shame. 

## Grandiosity

Western culture has long had a notion that men are the preferred gender. From the historical legacies of men having ownership of women and being legally allowed to assault one's wife (old English law allowed men to hit their wives with a stick no bigger than "the rule of thumb" would allow) to the present day, *patriarchy* — the codification of men having power over women — have cast men as being the privileged gender.

Given this shadow, patriarchy provides a context for understanding how some men behave towards women. When men assume they are entitled to more than their share of power and decision-making, it is known as grandiosity — a term to describe men who believe they deserve a bigger slice of the pie.

Grandiose entitlement can be expressed with or without conscious awareness (the latter can be called *implicit bias*). Grandiosity is seen in men who view themselves as better, who hold others in contempt, who believe others have little in common with themselves, and who assume they can only be understood by a few exceptional people.  

Grandiosity is reinforced by expectations of privilege — to be heard more, to speak more, to get paid more, to get one's own needs met first and foremost. Often these expectations are not recognized. Part of male privilege is not seeing male privilege. But male privilege comes with a cost. Grandiosity is accompanied by suffering for both the individual and those around him. Some of the consequences for the grandiose individual are alienation from others, relationship strain, lack of authenticity and isolation, along with deeper mental health concerns like emptiness, loneliness or depression.

## Shame

*Shame* is another fallout of the Male Code. The Male Code is developed and maintained by both internalized and externalized expressions of shame. As shame is the consequence of failing to meet the virtually impossible standards one is supposed to live by, many men experience a type of "default shame" because of attempting, and invariably failing, to meet the requirements of *The Big Impossible.* 

From an early age onwards, most boys are made to feel ashamed by feelings of so-called weakness, vulnerability and fear. Over time, shame gets internalized in the form of self-loathing, "loss of self," and feelings of insignificance, weakness or unmanliness. This prolonged exposure (known as *shame-hardening*) results in *shame-phobia* — an avoidance of activities that may result in shame. 

How trauma deepens the shame response will be explored later in this book. Fear of shame often cuts men off from those they love and from their genuine selves, leaving them with rigid yet mandated standards to live by.

## Pathways For Wounded Men

In summary, most men abused as children have suffered a "one-two punch" of experience. The first hit occurs to the male psyche via the harsh codification of masculinity. The second comes from the abuse itself. 

Past abuse typically leads to three "pathways" for wounded men:

**1) Resignation.** You have experienced fear and vulnerability, but the world tells you that if you're scared and vulnerable, you are not a man. You resign yourself to this ambiguous state of being. You can't identify as masculine because you see yourself as "weak." Emotional isolation is often a result. This could be characterized as living a "small life" — functioning well below one's potential. 

**2) Avoidance.** You think you were never abused, or believe that what happened to you did not affect you, or just made you tougher. You are not weak. You were never weak. And if anyone suggests that you are weak, you want to strike back. You can't handle other people being vulnerable either. You are the living essence of masculinity — what could be called hyper-masculinity. In fact, there is no part of you that is anything but masculine. The cost of taking on this adversarial role with the world may escape you. 

**3) Struggle.** You experience that same conflict of "vulnerability versus masculinity," but do not resign to it. Instead, you fight the fact that you feel "less than," that you feel you don't measure up to the impossible standards of gender. Similarly, you don't avoid or deny your pain. In time, you begin to question what the world is telling you about what it means to be a man — and chafe against much of the Male Code. All to say, you struggle.

If you are a man and you are reading this book in light of your own past, the third pathway, "struggle," may best depict you because you are acknowledging the wounds you carry. However, you may have lived much of your life in resignation or avoidance, exhausted those pathways, and come to struggle only recently. How long it has taken you to get here is less important than your next steps in recovery. Let's go there next.

## Chapter 3 Reflections

1. Review the following key concepts introduced in this chapter, and if appropriate, note any reflections or examples that come to mind on the following: *The Male Code (i.e., the Rugged Individual, The Big Man, Give'em Hell, Rejection of the Perception of Femininity and Homosexuality), The Big Impossible, invulnerability, Gender Role Strain (i.e., Discrepancy Strain, Trauma Strain, Dysfunction Strain), affective numbing, alexithymia, anhedonia, grandiosity, shame-hardening, shame-phobia, Pathways for Wounded Men (i.e., resignation, avoidance, struggle).*
2. Who were your role models for learning to become a man? How did your sexual identity, race, culture, religion, community and family history, etc. shape these learnings? What messages did you internalize and which did you modify or reject? 
3. How has your relationship with masculinity changed over the years? You could use aspects of the *Male Code*, *Gender Role Strain* and *Pathways for Wounded Men* to help you frame your answer.

## Fellow Traveller Quotes

*"It's always been a battle for me. I desperately want to be just like the men I looked up to as a boy. And at the same time, I can see how screwed up they really are."*

*"If you're raped, you're not a man. So I just accepted that. I could never be a man."*

*I always had to prove myself, be the best and the toughest.*

*Sometimes I see fathers kiss their sons before they go to school and they seem worried about how other people will perceive them. It's completely understandable, but our society's context can be so rigid.*
