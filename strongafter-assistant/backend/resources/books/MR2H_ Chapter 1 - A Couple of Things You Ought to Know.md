**Chapter 1**
# A Couple of Things You Ought to Know

Welcome to *Men’s Road to Healing*. Let me be presumptuous here — I believe you would fit into one of the following categories of readers:

- You are a man who has — or believe he has — experienced childhood physical, sexual and/or emotional abuse.
- You are a partner, parent, or friend of one of these men.
- You are a counsellor or therapist for men dealing with trauma and recovery. 

This is a book about *speaking truth* to experiences that many men have been reluctant to identify in their lives: their wounds from childhood. Just as truth is the first casualty of war, it is also the first casualty of trauma.  

These wounds are often wrapped in silence, which does nothing to promote healing. This book speaks to the silence that has embraced too many men for too long.

*Men’s Road to Healing* acknowledges struggle — struggle to understand the past, struggle to move forward, and often, struggle even being present in the here-and-now. 

It is thus a guide to help wounded men understand and effectively deal with their trauma to get on with their lives. 

For over 25 years, I have been at the helm of one of the few mental health centres in North America for men designed to address men’s healing from childhood abuse. Our model of service is based on the experiences of the more than 5,000 men who have benefited from working with our clinic in Ottawa, Canada. Many of this book’s teachings have been gleaned from our focused trauma work with men, particularly our group therapy programs, and its contents have been road-tested in groups, workshops, trainings and conferences. These teachings will help make sense of feelings that can be overwhelming, complex and perplexing.

This book also speaks of *courage* — including your own. Why would you pick up this book otherwise? Even if there is only a part of you that believes you were abused and there is only a chance of bettering yourself  — then this book is for you. You don’t have to be convinced — you just have to remain open. The effort you are making in reading these pages is *courage in action*, and I encourage you to acknowledge and celebrate that. Hurrah for you!

Finally, this book is about *hope*. The hope that the legacy of abuse in your life can be overcome. The hope that there is a better life not only for you, but for your loved ones as well. Trauma can be over-come, but  it takes time, courage and work.  It may be the toughest undertaking of your life. It may be the most important undertaking of your life. 

*One can live a happier, healthier life*. I would not have committed the last three decades of my professional life without this belief. You may, at times, feel so alone in your pain, like you’re the only one. You may feel hopeless. You may be dealing with substance abuse, or consumed  with self-doubt and rage that everything looks bleak. Yet, if you feel the tiniest sense of hope, the slightest inclination of reading the next page, or curious what taking the next step could look like, I encourage you to keep reading.

In spirit, in brotherhood, let’s walk together.

*"Learning about trauma recovery is awesome! Working the muscle has been the hard part. Ain’t nothing easy, but the alternative — like, never getting better — is a LOT tougher. - Fellow Traveller*

## Imagining Your Destination

Before reading further, I would like you to use your imagination. Imagination often precedes actions. Imagination can aid your healing journey as well. You may need to ponder some big questions to know what exactly you’re trying to achieve. Consider this question:

*Suppose your goals for recovery were met tonight as you slept. How would your life be different when you awoke?*

Let your imagination run free in this exercise. Try to envision a picture of your destination and what it would feel like to arrive. Your imagination, along with knowledge, will get you to the finish line. Imagination allows for possibilities — it is the call of the daring. Let it become your North Star.

## About Childhood Wounds

This book focuses on the *response to trauma* — the overwhelming experience that past events have had on your life. Trauma may be a new word to consider, or it may be as familiar to you as a dirty shirt. No matter. Trauma is the present-day injury from the abuse of the past. The emphasis here is on the process of recovery from trauma. 

Not everyone who has experienced childhood abuse ends up being traumatized. Remind yourself that abuse is an inescapable event that often, but not always, overwhelms people’s coping mechanisms. And the consequence of abuse can last indefinitely — years, if not decades, later. Trauma does not necessarily fade with time. 

This book is for the readers who responded affirmatively to the question, “Were you abused as a child?” This is a *subjective* approach, which is vastly different from having met the criteria for an *operational* definition of abuse. The same delineation can be made about the term trauma as well. Remember this: abuse was something *done to you* — it is not part of who you are. A “traumatic event” is personal and open to interpretation. And the only expert at the end of the day is you. 

You may have a sense of the wounds you carry. A mental health professional may use the terms *Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Complex PTSD*, or some other label; yet you are the one who truly knows. Childhood wounds can be experienced physically, sexually, or emotionally, and can include issues of neglect, coercion and bullying. These wounds are considered developmental trauma, as they interfere with the child’s psychosocial development and they may persist into adulthood. 

There is no need to list all the examples of various types of childhood abuse as no one finds themselves in lists (there are many sources for types of victimization, if that is a particular learning need). As a reader, you no doubt know much of your own story. Start there. 

If you are an ally (e.g., partner, friend, family member), you likely are aware of some of the person’s history to know that he has experienced trauma. Details may be ex-  traneous to your role in supporting him. Let him tell you his story when he is ready. You can be his witness.

*It is a process. I feel as if I literally have to start from the beginning and discover who I am. Given my past, it’s not a surprise. - Fellow Traveller*

## The Abuse of Boys

No one knows how many males are *sexually* abused as children. It is estimated that about *one in six males* experience “contact” sexual abuse by age 18. This figure is an average of many North American research studies. Contact sexual abuse means abuse that involves touch between the victim and the person(s) who offended them. Children and youth can also experience sexual abuse that does not involve touch, such as exposure to pornography or a parent purposely disrobing themselves for sexual arousal. If these other noncontact forms of sexual abuse were included in this research, higher overall rates would be found. 

Specific populations of males are known to have higher rates of sexual abuse. Research suggests that Indigenous men, Queer men (i.e., gay and bisexual men and trans folks), men who have been incarcerated, and men with disabilities are known to experience higher rates of childhood abuse. There is still much to learn about who is impacted by this issue and to what degree. 

Boys are also at greater risk of sexual abuse if they are living with neither or only one parent, those whose parents are separated, divorced, and/or remarried, and those whose parents abuse substances and/or are involved in criminal behaviour.

One of the challenges for researchers is that children, especially males, will generally not acknowledge that they were abused. In one study, only 16% of 30-year-old men with documented histories of childhood sexual abuse considered themselves to have been sexually abused, compared to 64% of their female counterparts. As a result, male sexual abuse is commonly underestimated. 

On average, boys experience sexual abuse between the ages of nine and ten. The age range at which boys are first abused, however, is from infancy to late adolescence. Some patterns of abuse may last into adulthood. Boys who experience contact sexual abuse are subjected to acts ranging from fondling to anal rape. Multiple incidents and perpetrators are not uncommon. 

Those who sexually offend boys and male youth are most likely people in a position of trust outside the immediate family. They can include extended family members, family friends, peers, and strangers, as well as parents and siblings. While most perpetrators of males are male, females are believed to offend in about 40% of cases. For a myriad of reasons, it is believed that abuse by females is harder for boys to identify than abuse by males. This will be examined in detail later in the book. 

While *physical abuse* is more common than sexual abuse, even less is known about how many men are affected by it. In part, it is hard for researchers to come to a consensus on what constitutes physical abuse and what does not. Physical punishment of children is still considered lawful in many jurisdictions around the world. Estimates suggest that one in four men have experienced *significant* physical abuse as children.

There is also a great deal of uncertainty with regard to the prevalence of other forms of childhood harm, from witnessing family violence to experiencing emotional abuse, neglect and chronic bullying. As no one knows how many men have been harmed as children, let alone how to define it, it will be up to you to decide about your own life. 

## Trauma Loads and More

Many male survivors want to understand why they feel the way they do and how this compares to the experiences of other men. It doesn’t help that men, let alone society, don’t often seek open discussions on men’s mental health. Men, more often than not, just don’t want to talk about it. 

I want you to consider a term that may be new to you: trauma load. A trauma load refers to your accumulated wounds from childhood, as well as adult experiences of being wounded, including experiences that are known as *revictimization*. 

Your trauma load isn’t as simple as counting the number of times you were abused. Sometimes, a man who was abused once by someone who be-trayed his trust may experience a heavier trauma load and may have more problems than a man who was repeatedly abused by an acquaintance. 

People are different. Trauma is tricky.

Research has shown that many factors can affect the extent of trauma in a man’s life:

- How *old* you were at the time — it is generally thought that the younger one was when abused, the more severe the trauma.
- The *type of abuse* you experienced — there are many types of abuse, and some types may be more - severe (e.g., when the male experienced penetration by his offender(s)).
- The *number* of people who hurt you.
- The *relationship* you had with the person(s) who hurt you — if trust was part of the relationship, it may result in a deeper sense of betrayal.
- The *frequency* of the abuse and its *duration*.
- Whether you experienced other *forms of victimization*.
- The use of *force or threat* in the abuse (to yourself, your loved ones, including pets) or a *threat of abandonment* that accompanied the abuse.
- Whether or not you were *believed* by others (assuming you shared what happened).
- Whether or not you *received support afterwards* from non-offending family, friends, and potentially helpful authorities (i.e., child protection, police, counselling services).
- Your *interpretation* of the event at the time. For example, did you feel that you brought on the abuse because of something you did, or did you place the responsibility solely with the person(s) who hurt you?
- Whether you experienced pressure to *recant* or take back your story.
- How you *coped* afterwards to deal with the experience. Younger children generally have fewer coping mechanisms than older children.
- The presence of *other problems in your family of origin* prior to the abuse. For example, family violence, alcoholism, mental health issues, separation, poverty and a parent’s incarceration may be compounding factors.

These experiences may affect a man’s degree of pain and trauma. Additionally, variables in personality can impact one’s resiliency.

In sum, if you believe you have been harmed in your childhood, then you have been harmed. You don’t need to quantify (or qualify) this to anyone to pursue your recovery. Comparing yourself to others or to some other standard — while a normal response — doesn't tend to help with recovery. Your experience and journey is what matters. 

*I grew up with four older siblings.  Nobody ever asked me, “Hey, is it okay if we do this?” They did humiliating and awful things. To this day they have never apologized or seen it as anything damaging. - Fellow Traveller*

## The Role of Memory

Your engagement with this book indicates that you have some memory of your childhood wounds. But memory has limitations, and no one remembers everything. 

You may remember that things weren’t right. You may have “shards” of memory that something may have happened, yet make no sense as a storyline. 

Sometimes there may be evidence of things that have happened, not due to recall, but in a pattern of behaviours in one’s adult life, such as:

- Non-proportionate expressions of emotion, or the seeming absence of emotional expression 
- Chronic experiences of spacing out, detachment, feelings of unreality or disorientation
- Proneness to distrust, anger, rage, and aggression
- Patterns of experiencing harm as an adult (e.g., being abused by one’s partner, placing oneself in unsafe physical or sexual situations)
- Substance abuse
- Patterns of withdrawal and isolation from others
- Problematic patterns in intimate relationships
- Debilitating compulsive behaviours
- Patterns of “acting out” or risk-taking behaviours, either as a youth or an adult 
- Eating disorders and/or patterns of preoccupation with one’s body, shape and look
- Patterns of harming one’s physical self
- Thoughts or actions that could be considered suicidal in nature
- Experiencing problems in one’s sexual identity or sexual expression that seem connected to the past
- Conflict with authority figures, such as bosses, police officers and the like

This list may help you to acknowledge behaviours with a possible connection to your past. This book will explore many of these traits in detail. 

Here is the bottom line: if you remember some of your childhood trauma, you can begin the healing journey. Full memory is not required. In fact, the quest for full memory can be a distraction. Some men spend excessive time and resources trying to recall more memory through hypnosis or other means, thinking that memory alone will get them to a healing place. 

Remember this: you can start your journey when you choose to do so. 

*I've got enough trauma to last me a lifetime. it felt good being told I don't NEED to recover fully detailed memories to work on recovery. - Fellow Traveller*

## Who To Tell?

If truth is the first casualty of trauma, then speech is the next. Many men won’t speak of their wounds for a variety of reasons — self-protection, shame, and/or a sense that speaking about their wounds would be at odds with their sense of masculinity.

Think about the various circles of people in your life. Consider the following: your partner or best friend, your immediate family, your family of origin, other friends, work colleagues, and lastly, strangers. Then think about with whom you have shared (or would share) information about your inner fantasies, your drug use, things you have stolen, harms you have experienced, and harms you have done.

You may find a rather complex pattern of disclosure and secret-keeping. 

No one discloses everything to everyone. Discernment is used to share big stories for good reason. Yet, society often expects full disclosure of those who are survivors. No wonder only a small portion of victims of sexual crimes call the police.

Your decision to keep your story to yourself may be a trust issue. If you think of what you experienced as being an extreme form of betrayal, your silence may feel justified. This is your decision first and foremost. You may keep your story — or parts of it — to yourself, or you may share it.

Consciously or not, many men take their stories of abuse to their graves. This is not an exaggeration. While we don’t know how prevalent this silence is, we do know that for those seeking a healing journey, telling their story is an essential step in the journey to healing.

Time to start the journey. Let’s get rolling:

- Write down the words, “I was abused.” 
- Say these words aloud to yourself.
- Take a bit of time to write down the key elements of your story. This can be the first entry in a journal. (Now would be a good time to get a book and a good pen for this purpose, if you haven’t already done so).
- After writing down your story, say it aloud to yourself.
- If you have the opportunity, share parts of your story to others anonymously, like in an online discussion group for male survivors.
- If you are in a relationship of safety and trust, rehearse saying the words: “I was abused” and then say these words to that person.
- Consider sharing further within trust relationships you may have (e.g., friend(s), partner, family and/or your therapist).

Your story begins with this three-word sentence: “I was abused.” Once this is said, the rest of your story can follow.

## How to Read This Book

Here are some guidelines to help you get the most out of *Men’s Road to Healing*: 

**Make a commitment to yourself.** While the impetus of focusing on your wounds may have come from a relationship crisis or some other external event, the core work ahead is for yourself, by yourself. This work won’t be easy, so keep your eyes on the prize. 

**Play the long game.** The journey of recovery is long haul work, and it cannot be rushed. The river cannot be pushed. Stay focused, treat your body well, practise self-compassion, and moderate your drinking, drugging or other related “go-to” coping mechanisms. This will help keep you strong for the journey. 

**Put yourself in the driver’s seat.** Trauma recovery doesn’t happen to you; you make it happen. Active reflection on insights that come to you (e.g., in your journal) is certainly useful, *and* you will also have to make incremental changes in the parts of your life that are no longer working for you.

**Digest slowly.** Trauma recovery is not a race, and you may lose some insightful reflection by plowing through the book’s content (and you also may become triggered). Pace yourself. Just like the importance of eating food slowly for better digestion, practise slow reading. The slower you go, the faster you may get to your destination.

**Read this book in order.** “First things first” applies to this kind of work. The chapters are arranged like the building of a house — foundational issues come first, then the framing of the house, the roof, and so on. Don’t skip ahead. Recovery doesn’t work like that.

**Make four letter words count.** Two words to consider for now: risk and pass. Practise “I’ll take a risk” in the sense of taking baby steps into the unknown of your work ahead. Nudge yourself in areas where you haven’t yet gone. As well, allow yourself the right to “I’ll take a pass” on anything or anybody that does not feel right for you. It may not be right for now, or it may not be right at all. You have the responsibility to take risks and the right to take a pass on any step in your journey ahead. 

**Reach out.** Find others to accompany you on this journey. This may mean involving a friend, trusted advisor, fellow travellers who are on a similar journey, perhaps even a therapist (see the next section for some guidance on how to pick one). You can’t  heal in isolation.

**Find community: group therapy, peer support or online engagement.** There is a Nigerian expression that attests to the strength of fellowship: “One finger cannot pick up a stone.” When you have comradery with others who have a similar past, you can experience deep understanding, share your burden, become fellow role models for healing and give each other emotional support. There is strength in numbers. 

**Take rest stops.** Some of the journey ahead involves rough terrain, while other sections will be smooth. Adjust yourself accordingly. Take rest stops as needed. You may want to take breaks periodically when reading this book. When you do, take a look behind you to see how far you have come. Feel good about your progress. Revisit those steps with fresh eyes. 

Each chapter in *Men’s Road to Healing* also contains key questions for your further reflection. These questions may help guide you in journaling about your experiences, and in your learning and reflection. Each chapter also contains quotes taken from a variety of sources, including statements from men who have been on this journey ahead of you. You will also find occasional QR codes throughout the book that link to short videos we produced with our American agency partner *1in6, Inc.* Lastly, at the end of the book, you will find references for each chapter and recommendations for further reading. 

*My feelings are still so confused about that time in my life. Once it led to a police investigation, and one of the detectives said to me, "You were a victim of sexual assault." That statement rocked my world. - Fellow Traveller*

## A Note About Language

As this book is aimed at *male-identified individuals*, I will make frequent use of the terms boys, male youth and men. Of course, there is a myriad of gender and sexual identities, and the intent is not to limit or exclude any individual who has experienced woundedness from childhood. As gender plays a core role in who we all are, it impacts not only the immediate experience of the abuse but how such injuries are later expressed. One’s gender identity is also critical in how to chart the healing journey. All that said, if this book can speak to you, let it. 

Men’s “significant others”, wives, husbands, lovers, are all referenced in the book by the singular term of “partner”. Of course, a man may have more than one such person in their life, and no slight is intended. 

As a male-identified person myself, I will occasionally include myself in the notion of “we as men”, referring to a shared connection, a men’s circle, the male condition. Also, I want to share that I am a survivor of childhood sexual abuse as well. However, this book is not about me, and I won’t be sharing my own story of wounding and recovery. 

The term *survivor* is limiting, but it will be used as the default term for those with the lived experienced of childhood trauma of whatever form. Not all will resonate with this short-cut terminology, despite having this history. For one thing, the term does not provide an accurate picture of who you are as a person. In a similar vein, most men, despite their experience of childhood abuse, will not identify with the term victim. I will limit that term to framing the origins of the harm experienced. 

This may leave the question of whether or not you need to embrace the term *survivor*. When language shifts from describing experiences to putting labels on people, it may arguably shortchange their identity to only a particular subset of experience. The *survivor identity* is limiting to the unique and beautiful complexity that defines you as an individual. Nonetheless, to work through trauma recovery, you may find this identifier useful, at least for a while.

Conversely, some readers may feel held back and constrained by any labels. Perhaps these words may sound foreign to you — keeping you stuck in a box or making you feel pressured to categorize yourself even before coming to terms with your past. It is up to you which word(s) you want to identify with:

victim
survivor
someone with lived experience of abuse

If you don’t identify with any of the above terms, I would suggest you replace them with your first name. Your journey will be the same. 

You also need to consider the language you use to describe the person(s) who harmed you. There could be a myriad of words to describe who that person was, and there is the same risk of loss of complexity by giving a simple label to these people: abuser, offender, perpetrator and the like. For some, this is a simple decision. For others, their relationship to the person who harmed them is complex, nuanced, filled with ambivalence or even loving regard. 

What name do you want to give to the person(s) who harmed you? Your call.

*You can’t just turn if off. I feel it’s part of me all of the time and has been part of me my entire life. So, if we give it a name or label it, can we change it? - Fellow Traveller*

## A Note to Loved Ones

To be a survivor of childhood trauma can be a hellish experience. To be a partner or loved one to a survivor can be hellish too.

Some days I take calls to our clinic, and I am always surprised by how many callers are from those who are concerned about the men in their lives. Partners, parents, siblings, even employers have called asking how they can get someone into therapy. The answer is simple: he must want to do the work himself.

Support has many forms, and these callers show it in their regard. Some offer payment, some offer accompaniment. If they could do the work these men need to do, many would. Yet, all the peace, love and understanding will not make anyone walk the path to healing who is refusing to acknowledge the wounds he is carrying. 

While he is not responsible for the abuse he experienced, the survivor himself is responsible for his recovery. Repeat that statement as often as you need: It’s not his fault, but it is his problem. Many folks stick to their men out of love that is so big it may be too big. Often, it can be at the loved one’s own expense: their hope collides with reality. People have stayed in relationships that are painful, dysfunctional, and abusive, hoping their man will change. 

While you can support him in his journey, you can’t make him do it. Time, expense, wasted hope against all hope — these are the possible costs of this larger-than-life effort to make someone change. Let alone the price you pay when you receive harsh words suggesting you need to mind your own business.

He is your loved one, not your project. He must want to change his life. You can support him by walking beside him, walking *with* him, providing understanding and support yet not trying to push or pull. Remind yourself to stay in your lane, though. Respecting his boundaries also means respecting *your* boundaries — the best distance for everyone involved. 

## A Note to Therapists and Peer Supporters

Some readers may be helping professionals, be it counsellors, psychotherapists, pastoral workers, addiction specialists, etc. If so, I hope you find this book helps you in your work with men.

Other readers may identify as being “peer supporters”, playing a helpful role to others, but without formal training. While there is a difference between these two categories of helpers, peer-support workers share the same lived experience as the people they serve.

Regardless of your helping role, your accompaniment with men who seek recovery is most welcome. Just as there are healthcare professionals who have this lived experience (me, for example), there are accomplished peer support workers that bring a good deal of self-knowledge to the situation.

Regardless of your role helping men heal from their childhood wounds, please know you are providing a vital service. Men dealing with trauma have often been ignored for too long. Your work is critical to help these men live healthier and happier lives. I applaud your efforts. 
 
This book, along with other resources written for trauma-care providers, could frame the content of individual and group sessions and be used for guidance in your work with men. You could work section by section with your client, for instance, allowing the content and key questions to structure your sessions. I invite you to consider this as a supplement or guide to your work. 

May we all give each other strength.
