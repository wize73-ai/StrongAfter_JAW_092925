A trauma load refers to your accumulated wounds from childhood, as well as adult experiences of being wounded, including experiences that are known as *revictimization*.\n\nYour trauma load isn't as simple as counting the number of times you were abused. Sometimes, a man who was abused once by someone who be-trayed his trust may experience a heavier trauma load and may have more problems than a man who was repeatedly abused by an acquaintance. \n\nPeople are different.

          "text": "## Emotional Compression\n\nStudies have shown that women have greater emotional awareness and a larger emotional lexicon than men. Researchers are unsure as to the reasons for this difference \u2014 a matter of brain wiring or socialization or both. Whereas femininity connotes being in relationship with others, masculinity suggests individualism and invulnerability. \n\nMen tend to display less emotional depth in communication, perhaps relying on women to do more of the \"emotional work.\" The advent of boys' puberty marks the beginning of constricted emotional expression between male friends. Overall, males' emotional and social richness tends to atrophy. Their range of emotional granularity (i.e., precise emotional articulation) also diminishes. \n\nBefore proceeding, let's continue to explore why we have emotions in the first place. Emotions serve as an \"early warning system\" \u2014 a way of protecting oneself physically (fear in the face of danger), interpersonally (anger reflecting a violation of boundaries) as well as strengthening emotional intimacy (guilt signals a breach of connection with others). With every emotion, there is a powerful feedback loop to ourselves and others. \n\n*Affective numbing* describes a lack of emotional awareness and expression for many men who experienced abuse as a child. It is a symptom of trauma and manifests as an inability to sense or speak about one's emotions. Affective numbing constrains many men, not only those who have been abused. \n\n*Alexithymia* is similar. Individuals with alexithymia experience emotions but have a hard time naming and expressing them. Instead, when asked about their emotions, they may describe physical symptoms or relay the events of their day instead. A somewhat  related concept is *anhedonia* \u2014 the inability to feel pleasure. While these conditions may not be directly related to a trauma response, they are experiences found most often in men.",

This is a skill that needs to be practised repeatedly, like any ability. This section will provide some practical tips on how to communicate with greater awareness, ability and integrity \u2014 something men and trauma survivors often have trouble doing.  \n\nMany men have ingrained patterns of communication in which their real needs are often unmet in relationships. In part, this is due to stoicism and self-sacrifice \u2014 endemic traits in modern masculinity (themes that will be explored in the next chapter). Survivors of trauma often protect themselves against vulnerability and connection as well. Their personal needs  often have been overridden by other people's needs, which creates confusion, conflict avoidance and/or an unwillingness to allow for vulnerability with others, resulting in a no-win situation for all. \n\nThat said, trouble may follow whenever the individual focuses solely on his own needs (which may be interpreted as aggressive), ignoring his own needs (being passive), or ignoring the needs of both (creating a passive-aggressive dynamic). These patterns could prove harmful to his relationships, including how he generally interacts with everyone \u2014 in sum, his relational self. Many men need to be reminded about the strength and clarity of assertiveness, whereby both one's own needs and the other person's needs can be respected. \n\nThe principle of assertiveness can help you to stand up for your rights and needs while respecting the rights and needs of others. Responsible assertiveness involves:",

Chapter 3 will explore this connection between masculinity and emotional constriction further \u2014 the throttling of one's emotional expression due to gender coding. \n\nIn our group work, men are reminded that emotional reflection is what counts, rather than sharing their thoughts or responding in a superficial manner. Surface responses don't tell us anything meaningful, nor help you gain insight. Given that men historically haven't been encouraged to be emotionally expressive, superficiality is not that surprising. They are often brought up instead to be the silent ones. \n\nNo doubt there are times when you don't know what you feel or you can't articulate the feeling. When this occurs, take the time you need. Even an experience of emotional \"neutrality\" can be explored. It may feel like waking up from a nap. If it fits, \"calm\" might be a good label for your feelings (or thoughtful, relaxed, content, etc.).\n\nYet, being neutral may also be akin to being cut off from your feelings. In those cases, you could say you are feeling \"numb\" (or emotionless, disoriented, dissociated, etc.). The target is emotional clarity.\n\nThis is in part the purpose of emotional expression \u2014 it brings others closer. There is a certain sweetness when two people can give and receive this invitation to connect. In doing so, you can allow yourself to enter this \"truer\" aspect of relationship \u2014 and get some accompaniment on your journey as well. \n\n## The Principle Of Asking For What You Want",

Don't be put off by this word. Many men struggle with the thought of telling their family or friends about their past abuse. Without taking this third step, they would continue to live in isolation. Choosing emotional intimacy opens up the potential of untold riches in understanding, support, and expressions of love. \n\nWhile it may be challenging for folks of all genders, this third step is no doubt harder for men due to conventional masculine codes of behaviour that keep them distant from others (see Chapter 3 on how masculinity impacts our connection with others). \n\nEI may be especially hard for many survivors due to problems in developing trusting relationships with others.

Often, it must address years, if not decades, of avoidance, let alone curb or replace problematic coping mechanisms. No one can guide themselves to this place of recovery as they have never been there before. Guides are an essential part of the journey.\n\nHere is where a counsellor or therapist comes into play. While they are not the only helping relationship you may employ, their role may be critical for your recovery. They may be essential in your task of acknowledging your truth, hearing your story, and helping you acquire self-compassion. This is quite the responsibility. This level of support may be beyond what a loved one can provide. It often takes a concerned, trained and empathic \"outsider\" to help you chart your way.\n\nIf you are new to the healing process, consider finding a therapist to accompany you on this journey. Apart from learning skills and awareness of what it takes to recover from past abuse, your therapist can inject elements of trust, hope, safety and security. You no longer have to travel alone. \n\nAs the therapeutic relationship deepens over time, you may experience a deep emotional connection. This connection is restorative (a type of repair work), for you to feel unconditional regard, trust and safety \u2014 and will help undo some of the harm of the unsafe relationships you experienced when you were abused.  \n\nWhen you are shopping for a therapist, you may want to consider interviewing prospective helpers to see who can work best with you. You have the right to ask them about their experience, qualifications and approaches to working with the issues. You may also want to consider the following:",

Trauma may be a new word to consider, or it may be as familiar to you as a dirty shirt. No matter. Trauma is the present-day injury from the abuse of the past. The emphasis here is on the process of recovery from trauma. \n\nNot everyone who has experienced childhood abuse ends up being traumatized. Remind yourself that abuse is an inescapable event that often, but not always, overwhelms people\u2019s coping mechanisms. And the consequence of abuse can last indefinitely \u2014 years, if not decades, later. Trauma does not necessarily fade with time. \n\nThis book is for the readers who responded affirmatively to the question, \u201cWere you abused as a child?\u201d This is a *subjective* approach, which is vastly different from having met the criteria for an *operational* definition of abuse. The same delineation can be made about the term trauma as well. Remember this: abuse was something *done to you* \u2014 it is not part of who you are. A \u201ctraumatic event\u201d is personal and open to interpretation. And the only expert at the end of the day is you. ",

The slower you go, the faster you may get to your destination.\n\n*Read this book in order.* \"First things first\" applies to this kind of work. The chapters are arranged like the building of a house \u2014 foundational issues come first, then the framing, the roof, and so on.\n\nDon't skip ahead.

Practise \"I'll take a risk\" in the sense of taking baby steps into the unknown of your work ahead. Nudge yourself into areas where you haven't yet gone. As well, allow yourself the right to \"take a pass\" on anything or anybody that does not feel right for you. It may not be right for now, or it may not be right at all. You have the responsibility to take risks and the right to pass on any step in your journey. \n\n*Reach out.* Find others to accompany you on this journey. This may mean involving a friend, trusted advisor, fellow travellers who are on a similar journey, perhaps even a therapist (see the next section for some guidance on how to pick one). You can't  heal in isolation.\n\n*Find community: group therapy, peer support or online engagement.* There is a Nigerian expression that attests to the strength of fellowship: \"One finger cannot pick up a stone.\" When you have comradery with others who have a similar past, you can experience deep understanding, share your burden, become fellow role models for healing and give each other emotional support.

This is vastly different from being a victim of a hurricane or a car crash. At its core, childhood abuse is an act of betrayal.\n\nIn many respects, it makes \"good sense\" that many survivors are wary of trusting others \u2014 be it a new neighbour, a potential friend, a possible date \u2014 given this history. Fundamentally, if a man concludes that *people = trust = betrayal = suffering*, he will shun connection with anyone who wants to get close to him.\n\nThis is bound to cause problems because people are wired for connection. We are social beings. We are pack animals. For 99% of our time on this planet, we have eked out our existence by living in small bands, organizing ourselves to eat each day and not be eaten. We had to learn skills from each other, adapt to the norms of the group, arrange safety and protection, and get our needs met. This is how we survived as a species. This is who we are and how we are bound together. \n\nWhile someone may \"instinctively\" stay clear of other people as a reaction to betrayal, this isolation prevents healing because it is the very connection with others that is the ticket to recovery.\n\nWe talk about this extensively in our therapy groups. One example comes to mind. For instance, if you read all the self-help books in the world staying in an enclosed room, would you find healing? You would know a lot more, and you could say you were more prepared to take on the work ahead, but you would not experience substantive recovery.\n\nYou *cannot* heal in isolation. You cannot be your \"true self\" in isolation either. Even though you were hurt by other people, the only way to recover is being in relation with others. ",

          "text": "## Finding Allies On Your Journey\n\nBy now you understand that trauma recovery is no picnic. Instead, it's long haul work, fraught with complexities. Often, it must address years, if not decades, of avoidance, let alone curb or replace problematic coping mechanisms. No one can guide themselves to this place of recovery as they have never been there before. Guides are an essential part of the journey.\n\nHere is where a counsellor or therapist comes into play. While they are not the only helping relationship you may employ, their role may be critical for your recovery. They may be essential in your task of acknowledging your truth, hearing your story, and helping you acquire self-compassion. This is quite the responsibility. This level of support may be beyond what a loved one can provide. It often takes a concerned, trained and empathic \"outsider\" to help you chart your way.\n\nIf you are new to the healing process, consider finding a therapist to accompany you on this journey. Apart from learning skills and awareness of what it takes to recover from past abuse, your therapist can inject elements of trust, hope, safety and security. You no longer have to travel alone. \n\nAs the therapeutic relationship deepens over time, you may experience a deep emotional connection. This connection is restorative (a type of repair work), for you to feel unconditional regard, trust and safety \u2014 and will help undo some of the harm of the unsafe relationships you experienced when you were abused.  \n\nWhen you are shopping for a therapist, you may want to consider interviewing prospective helpers to see who can work best with you. You have the right to ask them about their experience, qualifications and approaches to working with the issues. You may also want to consider the following:",

This is one of the many paradoxes required for trauma recovery. We will explore that in a bit.\n\n## Emotional Literacy\n\nAll skills require practice. Men in therapy are no exception. Twice a meeting, men in our trauma recovery groups practise deepening their emotional expression:\n\n*\"Let's hear from everyone in our opening (closing) round and 'check-in.' In a few words, tell us how you are feeling right now, at this very moment (e.g. glad, sad, mad, anxious, calm, etc.). Feelings more than thoughts.\"*\n\nThis instruction rails against the ingrained principle of responding to \"How are you?\" with a facile, socially accepted reply like, \"I'm good.\" Yet, it is on this deeper, more profound level that we must start building emotional literacy. The work of expressing emotional vulnerability is essential \u2014 a form of truth-telling you can start practising in your day-to-day life. ",

Experience working with women does not necessarily translate into the same abilities *working with men*. Ask them about their knowledge, comfort and experience working with male clients. Don't overlook this aspect of care. \n\n3. Given the longer-term nature of trauma therapy, you need to determine whether the cost is *affordable*. Some therapists and agencies offer sliding fee scales depending on the client's income. Group therapy is also an option as it is more economical than individual therapy. \n\n4. Having a therapist with whom you feel comfortable, heard and who can challenge you is also key. You may also prefer one gender or another. Its important to find the right *click.*\n\nHere is another angle to consider: group therapy. Being in a group of other folks working on recovery, particularly men, may be helpful. You may learn as much from your \"fellow travellers\" as from the group therapist (often called a *facilitator*). You will meet other people who are dealing with similar problems, share ideas, as well as exchange emotional support. ",

The feeling of being cut off \u2014 avoidance, numbing, and patterns of isolation. Life stuck on repeat. Living in the past. Wishing for a better future. A tenuous connection to the here-and-now.\n\nToday may be the day you start to change that. Don't feel bad that you didn't do it yesterday. Perhaps you just weren't ready then. Perhaps now you are. \n\nAt our clinic, the average age of men seeking recovery from childhood trauma is 45 years old. Given that the average age of childhood sexual abuse for boys is between nine and ten years old, men are often waiting decades before they ask for help.

It doesn't help that men, let alone society, don't often seek open discussions on men's mental health. Men, more often than not, just don't want to talk about it. \n\nI want you to consider a term that may be new to you: trauma load. A trauma load refers to your accumulated wounds from childhood, as well as adult experiences of being wounded, including experiences that are known as *revictimization*.\n\nYour trauma load isn't as simple as counting the number of times you were abused. Sometimes, a man who was abused once by someone who be-trayed his trust may experience a heavier trauma load and may have more problems than a man who was repeatedly abused by an acquaintance. \n\nPeople are different. Trauma is tricky.\n\nResearch has shown that many factors can affect the extent of trauma in a man's life:",

Experience working with women does not necessarily translate into the same abilities *working with men*. Ask them about their knowledge, comfort and experience working with male clients. Don't overlook this aspect of care. \n\n3. Given the longer-term nature of trauma therapy, you need to determine whether the cost is *affordable*. Some therapists and agencies offer sliding fee scales depending on the client's income. Group therapy is also an option as it is more economical than individual therapy. \n\n4. Having a therapist with whom you feel comfortable, heard and who can challenge you is also key. You may also prefer one gender or another. Its important to find the right *click.*\n\nHere is another angle to consider: group therapy. Being in a group of other folks working on recovery, particularly men, may be helpful. You may learn as much from your \"fellow travellers\" as from the group therapist (often called a *facilitator*). You will meet other people who are dealing with similar problems, share ideas, as well as exchange emotional support. ",

As shame is the consequence of failing to meet the virtually impossible standards one is supposed to live by, many men experience a type of \"default shame\" because of attempting, and invariably failing, to meet the requirements of *The Big Impossible.* \n\nFrom an early age onwards, most boys are made to feel ashamed by feelings of so-called weakness, vulnerability and fear. Over time, shame gets internalized in the form of self-loathing, \"loss of self,\" and feelings of insignificance, weakness or unmanliness. This prolonged exposure (known as *shame-hardening*) results in *shame-phobia* \u2014 an avoidance of activities that may result in shame. \n\nHow trauma deepens the shame response will be explored later in this book.

The emphasis here is on the process of *recovery* from trauma. \n\nNot everyone who has experienced childhood abuse ends up being traumatized. Remind yourself that abuse is an inescapable event that often, but not always, overwhelms people's coping mechanisms. And the consequence of abuse can last indefinitely \u2014 years, if not decades, later. Trauma does not necessarily fade with time. \n\nThis book is for the readers who responded affirmatively to the question, \"Were you abused as a child?\" This is a *subjective* approach, which is vastly different from having met the criteria for an *operational* definition of abuse. The same delineation can be made about the term trauma as well. Remember this: abuse was something *done to you* \u2014 it is not part of who you are. A \"traumatic event\" is personal and open to interpretation. And the only expert at the end of the day is you. ",

Ownership of *feelings* may necessitate \"unpacking.\" Naming an emotion and acknowledging it as yours requires deep self-conscious reflection. Naming it allows you to take full responsibility to make whatever changes you wish to act on. \n\nTry to practise EI. Express how you are feeling (e.g., glad, sad, mad, scared, ashamed, etc.) without attributing external causes upon anything or anybody. No longer does your partner \"make\" you angry \u2014 the emotional state called \"anger\" stems from within you. Increasing your EI allows you to be more responsible and responsive. The people in your life will be able to understand both you and your inner process \u2014 core elements of maintaining and holding connection. \n\nThe goal is to practise *emotional granularity* \u2014 finding the precise language to communicate your felt states with others. Just like grains of sand, see if you can identify and articulate each feeling as it comes up. This is essential in *Step #1* (being honest with ourselves) as well as *Step #2* (being responsible for our behaviours and feeling states) and leads to *Step #3* (getting closer to others). \n\n*Step #1* and *Step #2* are the stuff of most therapy. They are critical skills in terms of living an authentic life. Suffice to say while Steps #1 and #2 are useful, they are not sufficient. This brings us to the third step.\n\nTo carry out this last step, you will need to identify who is \"significant\" in your life.

          "text": "## The Principle Of Emotional Integrity\n\nWhile emotional expression is important, it needs to be taken one step further. We call this deepening of relationships *Emotional Integrity (EI)*. While there are many definitions of the notion of integrity, EI focuses on matters of the heart \u2014 how we carry ourselves with \"significant \"(or important) people in our life.\n\nA simple way of understanding EI is this: matching our thoughts with our feelings and behaviours. The notion is to ensure that one \"walks the talk.\" While this is helpful, it doesn't tell us how to get there. For that, we need to dig into EI in a deeper, more profound way.\n\nThink of EI as putting emotional intelligence into action. It requires a three-step process, and for it to pay off, it must proceed in the order outlined: \n\n**Step #1: Be honest with yourself.** Easy to say, but not to do. Profound honesty. Keep in mind that many people wear blinders as to who they are, oblivious to their inner process, or how they come across to others. Radical self-acceptance is needed, much like seeing your entire image in a mirror and not turning away. As no one can judge if you are doing this yourself, you must be the final arbitrator of honesty. Fundamentally though, you cannot make any changes in your life (think trauma recovery) without succeeding in this first and primary step. Nothing in life can be achieved by shielding one's eyes.\n\n**Step #2:** Take responsibility for your feelings and behaviours. Again, easy to say, yet difficult to do. Even if you don't know what you are feeling, you have to own your behaviours and not blame them on your past, other people, etc. No longer can you say, \"she pushed my buttons\" or \"I just flipped out\" \u2014 nothing but full responsibility must be taken.

The work of expressing emotional vulnerability is essential \u2014 a form of truth-telling you can start practising in your day-to-day life. ",

Repeat that statement as often as needed: It's not his fault, but it is his problem. Many folks stick to their men out of love that is so big it may be too big. Often, it can be at the loved one's own expense: their hope collides with reality. People have stayed in relationships that are painful, dysfunctional, and even abusive, hoping their man will change. \n\nWhile you can support him in his journey, you can't make him do it. Time, expense, wasted hope against all hope \u2014 these are the possible costs of this larger-than-life effort to make someone change. You receive harsh words suggesting you need to mind your own business.\n\nHe is your loved one, not your project. He must want to change his life.

          "text": "Now here's the rub. We were all vulnerable as children. All chil-dren are. And the men who were abused were harmed by people, usually people in a position of trust. This is vastly different from being a victim of a hurricane or a car crash. At its core, childhood abuse is an act of betrayal.\n\nIn many respects, it makes \"good sense\" that many survivors are wary of trusting others \u2014 be it a new neighbour, a potential friend, a possible date \u2014 given this history. Fundamentally, if a man concludes that *people = trust = betrayal = suffering*, he will shun connection with anyone who wants to get close to him.\n\nThis is bound to cause problems because people are wired for connection. We are social beings. We are pack animals. For 99% of our time on this planet, we have eked out our existence by living in small bands, organizing ourselves to eat each day and not be eaten. We had to learn skills from each other, adapt to the norms of the group, arrange safety and protection, and get our needs met. This is how we survived as a species. This is who we are and how we are bound together. \n\nWhile someone may \"instinctively\" stay clear of other people as a reaction to betrayal, this isolation prevents healing because it is the very connection with others that is the ticket to recovery.\n\nWe talk about this extensively in our therapy groups. One example comes to mind. For instance, if you read all the self-help books in the world staying in an enclosed room, would you find healing? You would know a lot more, and you could say you were more prepared to take on the work ahead, but you would not experience substantive recovery.\n\nYou *cannot* heal in isolation. You cannot be your \"true self\" in isolation either. Even though you were hurt by other people, the only way to recover is being in relation with others. ",

Just like the importance of eating food slowly for better digestion, practise slow reading. The slower you go, the faster you may get to your destination.\n\n*Read this book in order.* \"First things first\" applies to this kind of work. The chapters are arranged like the building of a house \u2014 foundational issues come first, then the framing, the roof, and so on.\n\nDon't skip ahead. Recovery doesn't work like that.\n\n*Make four letter words count.* Two words to consider for now: risk and pass. Practise \"I'll take a risk\" in the sense of taking baby steps into the unknown of your work ahead. Nudge yourself into areas where you haven't yet gone. As well, allow yourself the right to \"take a pass\" on anything or anybody that does not feel right for you. It may not be right for now, or it may not be right at all. You have the responsibility to take risks and the right to pass on any step in your journey. \n\n*Reach out.* Find others to accompany you on this journey. This may mean involving a friend, trusted advisor, fellow travellers who are on a similar journey, perhaps even a therapist (see the next section for some guidance on how to pick one). You can't  heal in isolation.\n\n*Find community: group therapy, peer support or online engagement.* There is a Nigerian expression that attests to the strength of fellowship: \"One finger cannot pick up a stone.\" When you have comradery with others who have a similar past, you can experience deep understanding, share your burden, become fellow role models for healing and give each other emotional support.

Often, it must address years, if not decades, of avoidance, let alone curb or replace problematic coping mechanisms. No one can guide themselves to this place of recovery as they have never been there before. Guides are an essential part of the journey.\n\nHere is where a counsellor or therapist comes into play. While they are not the only helping relationship you may employ, their role may be critical for your recovery. They may be essential in your task of acknowledging your truth, hearing your story, and helping you acquire self-compassion. This is quite the responsibility. This level of support may be beyond what a loved one can provide. It often takes a concerned, trained and empathic \"outsider\" to help you chart your way.\n\nIf you are new to the healing process, consider finding a therapist to accompany you on this journey. Apart from learning skills and awareness of what it takes to recover from past abuse, your therapist can inject elements of trust, hope, safety and security. You no longer have to travel alone. \n\nAs the therapeutic relationship deepens over time, you may experience a deep emotional connection. This connection is restorative (a type of repair work), for you to feel unconditional regard, trust and safety \u2014 and will help undo some of the harm of the unsafe relationships you experienced when you were abused.  \n\nWhen you are shopping for a therapist, you may want to consider interviewing prospective helpers to see who can work best with you. You have the right to ask them about their experience, qualifications and approaches to working with the issues. You may also want to consider the following:",

Researchers are unsure as to the reasons for this difference \u2014 a matter of brain wiring or socialization or both. Whereas femininity connotes being in relationship with others, masculinity suggests individualism and invulnerability. \n\nMen tend to display less emotional depth in communication, perhaps relying on women to do more of the \"emotional work.\" The advent of boys' puberty marks the beginning of constricted emotional expression between male friends. Overall, males' emotional and social richness tends to atrophy. Their range of emotional granularity (i.e., precise emotional articulation) also diminishes. \n\nBefore proceeding, let's continue to explore why we have emotions in the first place. Emotions serve as an \"early warning system\" \u2014 a way of protecting oneself physically (fear in the face of danger), interpersonally (anger reflecting a violation of boundaries) as well as strengthening emotional intimacy (guilt signals a breach of connection with others). With every emotion, there is a powerful feedback loop to ourselves and others. \n\n*Affective numbing* describes a lack of emotional awareness and expression for many men who experienced abuse as a child. It is a symptom of trauma and manifests as an inability to sense or speak about one's emotions. Affective numbing constrains many men, not only those who have been abused. \n\n*Alexithymia* is similar. Individuals with alexithymia experience emotions but have a hard time naming and expressing them. Instead, when asked about their emotions, they may describe physical symptoms or relay the events of their day instead. A somewhat  related concept is *anhedonia* \u2014 the inability to feel pleasure. While these conditions may not be directly related to a trauma response, they are experiences found most often in men.",

As shame is the consequence of failing to meet the virtually impossible standards one is supposed to live by, many men experience a type of \"default shame\" because of attempting, and invariably failing, to meet the requirements of *The Big Impossible.* \n\nFrom an early age onwards, most boys are made to feel ashamed by feelings of so-called weakness, vulnerability and fear. Over time, shame gets internalized in the form of self-loathing, \"loss of self,\" and feelings of insignificance, weakness or unmanliness. This prolonged exposure (known as *shame-hardening*) results in *shame-phobia* \u2014 an avoidance of activities that may result in shame. \n\nHow trauma deepens the shame response will be explored later in this book. Fear of shame often cuts men off from those they love and from their genuine selves, leaving them with rigid yet mandated standards to live by.\n\nHow trauma deepens the shame response will be explored later in this book.

Experience working with women does not necessarily translate into the same abilities *working with men*. Ask them about their knowledge, comfort and experience working with male clients. Don't overlook this aspect of care. \n\n3. Given the longer-term nature of trauma therapy, you need to determine whether the cost is *affordable*. Some therapists and agencies offer sliding fee scales depending on the client's income. Group therapy is also an option as it is more economical than individual therapy. \n\n4. Having a therapist with whom you feel comfortable, heard and who can challenge you is also key. You may also prefer one gender or another. Its important to find the right *click.*\n\nHere is another angle to consider: group therapy. Being in a group of other folks working on recovery, particularly men, may be helpful. You may learn as much from your \"fellow travellers\" as from the group therapist (often called a *facilitator*). You will meet other people who are dealing with similar problems, share ideas, as well as exchange emotional support. ",

Often, it must address years, if not decades, of avoidance, let alone curb or replace problematic coping mechanisms. No one can guide themselves to this place of recovery as they have never been there before. Guides are an essential part of the journey.\n\nHere is where a counsellor or therapist comes into play. While they are not the only helping relationship you may employ, their role may be critical for your recovery. They may be essential in your task of acknowledging your truth, hearing your story, and helping you acquire self-compassion. This is quite the responsibility. This level of support may be beyond what a loved one can provide. It often takes a concerned, trained and empathic \"outsider\" to help you chart your way.\n\nIf you are new to the healing process, consider finding a therapist to accompany you on this journey. Apart from learning skills and awareness of what it takes to recover from past abuse, your therapist can inject elements of trust, hope, safety and security. You no longer have to travel alone. \n\nAs the therapeutic relationship deepens over time, you may experience a deep emotional connection. This connection is restorative (a type of repair work), for you to feel unconditional regard, trust and safety \u2014 and will help undo some of the harm of the unsafe relationships you experienced when you were abused.  \n\nWhen you are shopping for a therapist, you may want to consider interviewing prospective helpers to see who can work best with you.

          "text": "I invite you to think about different aspects of yourself \u2014 from your physical body, to your thoughts, feelings, behaviours, habitual or problematic patterns, and your relationships with others. Lastly, think about your relationship with yourself and who you truly are or want to be. \n\nLet your imagination run free in this exercise. Try to envision a picture of your destination and what it would feel like to arrive. Your imagination, along with knowledge, will help get you to the finish line. Imagination allows for possibilities \u2014 it is the call of the daring. Let it become your North Star.\n\n## About Childhood Wounds\n\nThis book focuses on the *response to trauma* \u2014 the overwhelming experience that past events have had on your life. Trauma may be a new word to consider, or it may be as familiar to you as a dirty shirt. No matter. Trauma is the present-day injury from the abuse of the past. The emphasis here is on the process of *recovery* from trauma. \n\nNot everyone who has experienced childhood abuse ends up being traumatized. Remind yourself that abuse is an inescapable event that often, but not always, overwhelms people's coping mechanisms. And the consequence of abuse can last indefinitely \u2014 years, if not decades, later. Trauma does not necessarily fade with time. \n\nThis book is for the readers who responded affirmatively to the question, \"Were you abused as a child?\" This is a *subjective* approach, which is vastly different from having met the criteria for an *operational* definition of abuse. The same delineation can be made about the term trauma as well. Remember this: abuse was something *done to you* \u2014 it is not part of who you are. A \"traumatic event\" is personal and open to interpretation. And the only expert at the end of the day is you. ",

It is not a linear process that can be intellectualized. Instead of escaping the pain of your body, mind and soul, you need to lean into the pain in a manageable way, not avoid it (see Chapter 9 for how this can be done). ",

And failure begets shame and a variety of compensatory coping mechanisms (including hyper-masculinity), which invariably compound tragic outcomes in their lives. Although many would not admit to it, men suffer. \n\n## Invulnerability As A Given\n\nIf the Male Code was distilled into one word, it would be *invulnerable*. Of course, invulnerable people (of whatever gender) cannot, by definition, be victimized. So, when a male is victimized, he faces an impossible position \u2014 identify with masculinity (and thus deny the victimization occurred) or acknowledge the harm done and face the perceived failure of not living up to the Male Code. In either case, the outcome is often unrelenting pain.  \n\nThe Male Code shapes trauma expression in ways that can be seen as conforming to its dictates: anger and rage, as well as qualities of reserve and stoicism. Indeed, the masculine ideal is self-reliance, which, as we will see in the next chapter, also happens to be a core trauma expression. \n\n## Gender Role Strain\n\nSubscribing to the Male Code causes pain and suffering for many men \u2014 this is known as *Gender Role Strain*.

          "text": "In summary, most men abused as children have suffered a \"one-two punch\" of experience. The first hit occurs to the male psyche via the harsh codification of masculinity. The second comes from the abuse itself. \n\nPast abuse typically leads to three \"pathways\" for wounded men:\n\n**1) Resignation.** You have experienced fear and vulnerability, but the world tells you that if you're scared and vulnerable, you are not a man. You resign yourself to this ambiguous state of being. You can't identify as masculine because you see yourself as \"weak.\" Emotional isolation is often a result. This could be characterized as living a \"small life\" \u2014 functioning well below one's potential. \n\n**2) Avoidance.** You think you were never abused, or believe that what happened to you did not affect you, or just made you tougher. You are not weak. You were never weak. And if anyone suggests that you are weak, you want to strike back. You can't handle other people being vulnerable either. You are the living essence of masculinity \u2014 what could be called hyper-masculinity. In fact, there is no part of you that is anything but masculine. The cost of taking on this adversarial role with the world may escape you. \n\n**3) Struggle.** You experience that same conflict of \"vulnerability versus masculinity,\" but do not resign to it. Instead, you fight the fact that you feel \"less than,\" that you feel you don't measure up to the impossible standards of gender. Similarly, you don't avoid or deny your pain. In time, you begin to question what the world is telling you about what it means to be a man \u2014 and chafe against much of the Male Code. All to say, you struggle.\n\nIf you are a man and you are reading this book in light of your own past, the third pathway, \"struggle,\" may best depict you because you are acknowledging the wounds you carry. However, you may have lived much of your life in resignation or avoidance, exhausted those pathways, and come to struggle only recently. How long it has taken you to get here is less important than your next steps in recovery. Let's go there next.",

          "text": "Boys are also at greater risk of sexual abuse if they are living with neither or only one parent, those whose parents are separated, divorced, and/or remarried, and those whose parents abuse substances and/or are involved in criminal behaviour.\n\nOne of the challenges for researchers is that children, especially males, will generally not acknowledge that they were sexually abused. In one study, only 16% of 30-year-old men with documented histories of childhood sexual abuse considered themselves to have been sexually abused, compared to 64% of their female counterparts. As a result, male sexual abuse is commonly underestimated. \n\nOn average, boys experience sexual abuse between the ages of nine and ten. The age range at which boys are first abused, however, is from infancy to late adolescence. Some patterns of abuse may last into adulthood. Boys who experience contact sexual abuse are subjected to acts ranging from fondling to anal rape. Multiple incidents and perpetrators are not uncommon. \n\nThose who sexually offend boys and male youth are most likely people in a position of trust outside the immediate family. They can include extended family members, family friends, peers, and strangers, as well as parents and siblings. While most perpetrators of males are male, females are believed to offend in about 40% of cases. For a myriad of reasons, it is believed that abuse by females is harder for boys to identify than abuse by males. This will be examined in detail later in the book. \n\nWhile *physical abuse* is more common than sexual abuse, even less is known about how many men are affected by it. In part, it is hard for researchers to come to a consensus on what constitutes physical abuse and what does not. Physical punishment of children is still considered lawful in many jurisdictions around the world. Estimates suggest that one in four men have experienced *significant* physical abuse as children.\n\nThere is also a great deal of uncertainty with regard to the prevalence of other forms of childhood harm, from witnessing family violence to experiencing emotional abuse, neglect and chronic bullying. As no one knows how many men have been harmed as children, or how to define it, it will be up to you to decide about your own life. ",

For boys and men, society has developed norms and expectations regarding their: \n\n* actions and behaviours\n* appearance and bodies\n* the type of jobs they should have\n* the ways in which they engage in romance and sex \n* and critically, the feelings they may show",

Of course, invulnerable people (of whatever gender) cannot, by definition, be victimized. So, when a male is victimized, he faces an impossible position \u2014 identify with masculinity (and thus deny the victimization occurred) or acknowledge the harm done and face the perceived failure of not living up to the Male Code.

Indeed, the masculine ideal is self-reliance, which, as we will see in the next chapter, also happens to be a core trauma expression. \n\n## Gender Role Strain\n\nSubscribing to the Male Code causes pain and suffering for many men \u2014 this is known as *Gender Role Strain*.

          "text": "In essence, the male-identified person not only has to be outwardly masculine (and not feminine) but outwardly heterosexual as well. Men need to reject any qualities within themselves that could be seen as queer (e.g., being creative, \"effeminate\" in expression, certain stereotypic occupations). Projection comes next: only \"gay guys\" do that, not \"real men.\" The end result may involve scorn and shaming \u2014 active discrimination against folks who are not \"truly\" men, creating the bedrock of *homophobia* (the contempt or hatred of queer people). \n\nThere is not much allowance for individuation and self-expression in all of this, is there? Conventional masculinity suggests a stripping down of men's humanness, a constriction of the men we were meant to be and a sense that masculinity means invulnerability.\n\nThese various aspects of the Male Code may influence your understanding about emotional disclosure, your expression of pain, and your ability to ask for help. Not surprisingly, adherence to some of these codes correlates to poorer mental and physical health outcomes for men, greater danger of being a victim of violence and premature death.\n\nThe Male Code harms men in many ways, including limiting emotional expression, taking undue physical risks, overly relying on one's work identity \u2014 all to the detriment of personal well-being as well as family and community involvement.\n\nFortunately, in recent times, there's been a shift away from the rigidity of the Male Code, in part fueled by feminism, popular culture, and the rise and broader acceptance of the queer community. Still, this social progression is not uniformly witnessed across society, with many men still set in traditional and harmful ways. The rise of social commentary from ideologues encouraging a return to rigid gender roles has not helped. The growth of the \"incel movement\" \u2014 the online subculture of men who claims injustice due to their lack of romantic or sexual success is another troubling sign of women-hating. And on the school yard, the name-calling of boys still tends to be labels of girl, pussy, sissy, and fag. \n\nIt is heartening that more and more men are questioning the masculine norms they grow up with. Many men are taking on egalitarian values, a softening of set roles, more room for self-expression, greater en-gagement in their emo-tional lives, and, in particular, greater father involvement. These changes may come at some cost for individual men as they reject what is expected of them. Still, the shadow of traditional masculinity looms over many men's psyches. Men who have been wounded are no exception. ",

A man may believe that as a husband or father he must not only put bread on the table, but must provide his family with shiny things \u2014 possibly things he never had when he was growing up. He may believe that being a good provider is paramount. By holding such a value, he may end up working so much that his relationships with his loved ones suffer. One day, he may find that his partner or children walk out on him as he has become a \"workaholic\" and neglected his family.\n\nOther consequences of Dysfunction Strain include: sexual compulsions, substance abuse, high-risk behaviour, absentee fathering, failure to share the \"emotional work\" in relationships, health problems and proneness to sexual coercion and aggression. \n\nThese three strains produce wounds that are often overlooked by society, and may go unrecognized by the individual male as it is seen as something to be expected. The cost of living with these strains is significant and includes relational discord, absent or poor fathering, risky behaviours and aggression. \n\nArguably all men, to various degrees, experience the painful shadow of masculinity. This state is not dependent of childhood abuse; rather, this is the lived reality of men in general. It's as if masculinity facilitates inadequacy, leaving many feeling empty in unfulfilling roles with consequences that may hold a similar weight like past abuse. Men may end up hurt and stifled and may cause the same pain for those around them. \n\n## The Social Construction Of Masculinity \n\nMasculinity is often measured by performance, an achievement that has only short-term effects.

          "text": "There is no need to discuss anatomical sex in examining how masculinity impacts men's lives as that has little to do with the social formulation of being men. Like the imperatives of conventional masculinity expression of non-femininity and compulsive heterosexuality, the projection of the male identity is both constructed and complex. \n\nThe male-identified self invariably interacts with other identities \u2014 racial and cultural identities, sexual orientation, and socio-economic class, among others. One can conclude that there are many, many masculinities after all, yet they all exist within the shadow of the dominant cultural expression of the Male Code. This results in how ideals of masculinity are celebrated in society (vs. traits that are ridiculed, or left unseen) and how men are supposed to act under this weight.  \n\nThere are male-identified folks who exist outside the binary of conventional masculinity \u2014 those who \"failed\" that definition. Some individuals actively reject these social conventions, challenging any gendered classification whatsoever, expressing their identities as being far outside these standards. Some live as true sexual \"outlaws,\" shunning many of the prescribed roles or lifestyles associated with masculinity. Other men take on gradual shifts in their self-definition of masculinity and slowly embrace, over time, the type of men they want to be. \n\nTransforming one's gender and sexual identities does not occur without cost or great effort, yet may allow for an honest and authentic expression of one's self. In many ways, these outliers to the Male Code may serve as role models to the rest of us in that they have paid the price, and borne the rewards, of living a life where they have defined themselves on their own terms.  \n\nAs a caveat, this is not to shame men for internalizing the Male Code. Some of these qualities have debatably served their purposes for men (and their societies over the millennium). For example, in certain contexts, they are arguably helpful (e.g., hunting, fighting fires, defending one's country from invaders). These qualities have been taken on for a reason, so its not all black-and-white. That said, we need to shed light on how the Male Code can inadvertently stymie men seeking recovery. Note that aspects of the Male Code also subjugate others (e.g., women, gay men, those who seemingly don't conform to its standards) and thus need to be challenged lest it continue to cause harm.  It is, yet again, another paradox to contemplate. \n\nIt is beyond the scope of this book to go further in depth on the Male Code. However, some studies have inferred a correlation between poor health outcomes and how certain values of the Male Code are held. In particular, both the Rugged Individual and Give'em Hell with their emphasis on risk-taking, isolation and proneness to violence suggests that adherence to these values results in men's higher rates of mortality.

Researchers are unsure as to the reasons for this difference \u2014 a matter of brain wiring or socialization or both. Whereas femininity connotes being in relationship with others, masculinity suggests individualism and invulnerability. \n\nMen tend to display less emotional depth in communication, perhaps relying on women to do more of the \"emotional work.\" The advent of boys' puberty marks the beginning of constricted emotional expression between male friends. Overall, males' emotional and social richness tends to atrophy. Their range of emotional granularity (i.e., precise emotional articulation) also diminishes. \n\nBefore proceeding, let's continue to explore why we have emotions in the first place. Emotions serve as an \"early warning system\" \u2014 a way of protecting oneself physically (fear in the face of danger), interpersonally (anger reflecting a violation of boundaries) as well as strengthening emotional intimacy (guilt signals a breach of connection with others). With every emotion, there is a powerful feedback loop to ourselves and others. \n\n*Affective numbing* describes a lack of emotional awareness and expression for many men who experienced abuse as a child. It is a symptom of trauma and manifests as an inability to sense or speak about one's emotions. Affective numbing constrains many men, not only those who have been abused. \n\n*Alexithymia* is similar. Individuals with alexithymia experience emotions but have a hard time naming and expressing them. Instead, when asked about their emotions, they may describe physical symptoms or relay the events of their day instead. A somewhat  related concept is *anhedonia* \u2014 the inability to feel pleasure. While these conditions may not be directly related to a trauma response, they are experiences found most often in men.",

The second comes from the abuse itself. \n\nPast abuse typically leads to three \"pathways\" for wounded men:\n\n**1) Resignation.** You have experienced fear and vulnerability, but the world tells you that if you're scared and vulnerable, you are not a man. You resign yourself to this ambiguous state of being. You can't identify as masculine because you see yourself as \"weak.\" Emotional isolation is often a result. This could be characterized as living a \"small life\" \u2014 functioning well below one's potential. \n\n**2) Avoidance.** You think you were never abused, or believe that what happened to you did not affect you, or just made you tougher. You are not weak. You were never weak. And if anyone suggests that you are weak, you want to strike back. You can't handle other people being vulnerable either. You are the living essence of masculinity \u2014 what could be called hyper-masculinity. In fact, there is no part of you that is anything but masculine. The cost of taking on this adversarial role with the world may escape you. \n\n**3) Struggle.** You experience that same conflict of \"vulnerability versus masculinity,\" but do not resign to it. Instead, you fight the fact that you feel \"less than,\" that you feel you don't measure up to the impossible standards of gender. Similarly, you don't avoid or deny your pain. In time, you begin to question what the world is telling you about what it means to be a man \u2014 and chafe against much of the Male Code. All to say, you struggle.\n\nIf you are a man and you are reading this book in light of your own past, the third pathway, \"struggle,\" may best depict you because you are acknowledging the wounds you carry. However, you may have lived much of your life in resignation or avoidance, exhausted those pathways, and come to struggle only recently.

Sex should be understood as purely a physical act, not an emotional, relational or spiritual one.\n\nThe Male Code demands that any feminine qualities held by the male must be *rejected*, then *projected* onto the \"other\" \u2014 the other being women \u2014 the only rightful recipients of these qualities. This often leads to disdain and judgement, with women being seen as \"less than,\" \"weaker than\" or \"softer than.\" One can ponder how this aspect of conventional masculinity contributes to the creation and maintenance of *misogyny* \u2014 in other words, contempt or hatred of females. \n\nShedding the softer side of human expression leaves men constricted and diminished as a result. For example, receiving the message that \"boys don't cry\" in one's early years can create an unwelcome legacy for men who are left unable to express their pain decades later.\n\n### #5: The Rejection of the Perception of Homosexuality\n\nThere is a parallel notion with respect to homosexuality.

          "text": "## Finding Allies On Your Journey\n\nBy now you understand that trauma recovery is no picnic. Instead, it's long haul work, fraught with complexities. Often, it must address years, if not decades, of avoidance, let alone curb or replace problematic coping mechanisms. No one can guide themselves to this place of recovery as they have never been there before. Guides are an essential part of the journey.\n\nHere is where a counsellor or therapist comes into play. While they are not the only helping relationship you may employ, their role may be critical for your recovery. They may be essential in your task of acknowledging your truth, hearing your story, and helping you acquire self-compassion. This is quite the responsibility. This level of support may be beyond what a loved one can provide. It often takes a concerned, trained and empathic \"outsider\" to help you chart your way.\n\nIf you are new to the healing process, consider finding a therapist to accompany you on this journey. Apart from learning skills and awareness of what it takes to recover from past abuse, your therapist can inject elements of trust, hope, safety and security. You no longer have to travel alone. \n\nAs the therapeutic relationship deepens over time, you may experience a deep emotional connection. This connection is restorative (a type of repair work), for you to feel unconditional regard, trust and safety \u2014 and will help undo some of the harm of the unsafe relationships you experienced when you were abused.  \n\nWhen you are shopping for a therapist, you may want to consider interviewing prospective helpers to see who can work best with you. You have the right to ask them about their experience, qualifications and approaches to working with the issues. You may also want to consider the following:",

          "text": "### Tips for Shopping for a Therapist:\n\n1. Just having credentials does not mean they have specific training or competency in *trauma* recovery. You will need to ask them. \n\n2. Experience working with women does not necessarily translate into the same abilities *working with men*. Ask them about their knowledge, comfort and experience working with male clients. Don't overlook this aspect of care. \n\n3. Given the longer-term nature of trauma therapy, you need to determine whether the cost is *affordable*. Some therapists and agencies offer sliding fee scales depending on the client's income. Group therapy is also an option as it is more economical than individual therapy. \n\n4. Having a therapist with whom you feel comfortable, heard and who can challenge you is also key. You may also prefer one gender or another. Its important to find the right *click.*\n\nHere is another angle to consider: group therapy. Being in a group of other folks working on recovery, particularly men, may be helpful. You may learn as much from your \"fellow travellers\" as from the group therapist (often called a *facilitator*). You will meet other people who are dealing with similar problems, share ideas, as well as exchange emotional support. ",

This work won't be easy, so keep your eyes on the prize. \n\n*Play the long game.* The journey of recovery is long haul work; it cannot be rushed. The river cannot be pushed. Stay focused, treat your body well, practise self-compassion, and moderate your drinking, drugging or other related \"go-to\" coping mechanisms. This will help keep you strong for the journey. \n\n*Put yourself in the driver's seat.* Trauma recovery doesn't happen to you; you make it happen. Active reflection on insights that come to you (e.g., in your journal) is certainly useful, and you will also have to make incremental changes to the parts of your life that are no longer working for you.",

Remind yourself that abuse is an inescapable event that often, but not always, overwhelms people\u2019s coping mechanisms. And the consequence of abuse can last indefinitely \u2014 years, if not decades, later. Trauma does not necessarily fade with time. \n\nThis book is for the readers who responded affirmatively to the question, \u201cWere you abused as a child?\u201d This is a *subjective* approach, which is vastly different from having met the criteria for an *operational* definition of abuse. The same delineation can be made about the term trauma as well. Remember this: abuse was something *done to you* \u2014 it is not part of who you are. A \u201ctraumatic event\u201d is personal and open to interpretation. And the only expert at the end of the day is you. ",

          "text": "## The Principle Of Emotional Integrity\n\nWhile emotional expression is important, it needs to be taken one step further. We call this deepening of relationships *Emotional Integrity (EI)*. While there are many definitions of the notion of integrity, EI focuses on matters of the heart \u2014 how we carry ourselves with \"significant \"(or important) people in our life.\n\nA simple way of understanding EI is this: matching our thoughts with our feelings and behaviours. The notion is to ensure that one \"walks the talk.\" While this is helpful, it doesn't tell us how to get there. For that, we need to dig into EI in a deeper, more profound way.\n\nThink of EI as putting emotional intelligence into action. It requires a three-step process, and for it to pay off, it must proceed in the order outlined: \n\n**Step #1: Be honest with yourself.** Easy to say, but not to do. Profound honesty. Keep in mind that many people wear blinders as to who they are, oblivious to their inner process, or how they come across to others. Radical self-acceptance is needed, much like seeing your entire image in a mirror and not turning away. As no one can judge if you are doing this yourself, you must be the final arbitrator of honesty. Fundamentally though, you cannot make any changes in your life (think trauma recovery) without succeeding in this first and primary step. Nothing in life can be achieved by shielding one's eyes.\n\n**Step #2:** Take responsibility for your feelings and behaviours. Again, easy to say, yet difficult to do. Even if you don't know what you are feeling, you have to own your behaviours and not blame them on your past, other people, etc. No longer can you say, \"she pushed my buttons\" or \"I just flipped out\" \u2014 nothing but full responsibility must be taken.

Researchers are unsure as to the reasons for this difference \u2014 a matter of brain wiring or socialization or both. Whereas femininity connotes being in relationship with others, masculinity suggests individualism and invulnerability. \n\nMen tend to display less emotional depth in communication, perhaps relying on women to do more of the \"emotional work.\" The advent of boys' puberty marks the beginning of constricted emotional expression between male friends. Overall, males' emotional and social richness tends to atrophy. Their range of emotional granularity (i.e., precise emotional articulation) also diminishes. \n\nBefore proceeding, let's continue to explore why we have emotions in the first place. Emotions serve as an \"early warning system\" \u2014 a way of protecting oneself physically (fear in the face of danger), interpersonally (anger reflecting a violation of boundaries) as well as strengthening emotional intimacy (guilt signals a breach of connection with others). With every emotion, there is a powerful feedback loop to ourselves and others. \n\n*Affective numbing* describes a lack of emotional awareness and expression for many men who experienced abuse as a child. It is a symptom of trauma and manifests as an inability to sense or speak about one's emotions. Affective numbing constrains many men, not only those who have been abused. \n\n*Alexithymia* is similar. Individuals with alexithymia experience emotions but have a hard time naming and expressing them. Instead, when asked about their emotions, they may describe physical symptoms or relay the events of their day instead. A somewhat  related concept is *anhedonia* \u2014 the inability to feel pleasure. While these conditions may not be directly related to a trauma response, they are experiences found most often in men.",

Often, it must address years, if not decades, of avoidance, let alone curb or replace problematic coping mechanisms. No one can guide themselves to this place of recovery as they have never been there before. Guides are an essential part of the journey.\n\nHere is where a counsellor or therapist comes into play. While they are not the only helping relationship you may employ, their role may be critical for your recovery. They may be essential in your task of acknowledging your truth, hearing your story, and helping you acquire self-compassion. This is quite the responsibility. This level of support may be beyond what a loved one can provide. It often takes a concerned, trained and empathic \"outsider\" to help you chart your way.\n\nIf you are new to the healing process, consider finding a therapist to accompany you on this journey. Apart from learning skills and awareness of what it takes to recover from past abuse, your therapist can inject elements of trust, hope, safety and security. You no longer have to travel alone. \n\nAs the therapeutic relationship deepens over time, you may experience a deep emotional connection. This connection is restorative (a type of repair work), for you to feel unconditional regard, trust and safety \u2014 and will help undo some of the harm of the unsafe relationships you experienced when you were abused.  \n\nWhen you are shopping for a therapist, you may want to consider interviewing prospective helpers to see who can work best with you. You have the right to ask them about their experience, qualifications and approaches to working with the issues. You may also want to consider the following:",

The feeling of being cut off \u2014 avoidance, numbing, and patterns of isolation. Life stuck on repeat. Living in the past. Wishing for a better future. A tenuous connection to the here-and-now.\n\nToday may be the day you start to change that. Don't feel bad that you didn't do it yesterday. Perhaps you just weren't ready then. Perhaps now you are. \n\nAt our clinic, the average age of men seeking recovery from childhood trauma is 45 years old. Given that the average age of childhood sexual abuse for boys is between nine and ten years old, men are often waiting decades before they ask for help.

They further hold responsibility for the climate of the group: when to dig deeper, when to shift focus, when to engage other individuals to ensure that \"talk time\" is shared and respectful. Almost all groups have guidelines around conduct. It is the therapist's job (not the group members) to ensure the group maintains safety and trust for all. \n\nGroup work provides connection with others. In many ways, it is like a laboratory to try out new awarenesses, share experiences that may be unvoiced, practise new skills of expression, vulnerability and allow for normalizing \u2014 no longer seeing oneself as the only one who went through a particular experience. By con-tributing their stories, participants will view their experiences differently.\n\nGroup therapy has been referred to as \"Triple E\" treatment: it is *equivalent* to the experience of individual therapy; it is seen as clinically *effective*, and lastly it is more *economical* than individual work.\n\nThe ideal arrangement is to consider both individual and group work concurrently as it will allow you to heal in different ways. Think of therapy as being analogous to the needs of trees. Tree roots require *depth* for sustenance \u2014 they need to go deep. This is the role of individual therapy. That therapy hour is just for you and is about you. Yet, tree roots also need to have *breadth* for stability, resourcing, and interconnection with other living things. That is the role for groups in all of its forms: facilitator-led therapy groups, peer-support groups (in which there is a group leader with the same lived experience), online support groups, and peer discussion boards. All allow for interactivity and mutual support.\n\nAllies in your healing are necessary. You can't do this work alone. \n\n## Chapter 2 Reflections",

Ownership of *feelings* may necessitate \"unpacking.\" Naming an emotion and acknowledging it as yours requires deep self-conscious reflection. Naming it allows you to take full responsibility to make whatever changes you wish to act on. \n\nTry to practise EI. Express how you are feeling (e.g., glad, sad, mad, scared, ashamed, etc.) without attributing external causes upon anything or anybody. No longer does your partner \"make\" you angry \u2014 the emotional state called \"anger\" stems from within you. Increasing your EI allows you to be more responsible and responsive. The people in your life will be able to understand both you and your inner process \u2014 core elements of maintaining and holding connection. \n\nThe goal is to practise *emotional granularity* \u2014 finding the precise language to communicate your felt states with others. Just like grains of sand, see if you can identify and articulate each feeling as it comes up. This is essential in *Step #1* (being honest with ourselves) as well as *Step #2* (being responsible for our behaviours and feeling states) and leads to *Step #3* (getting closer to others). \n\n*Step #1* and *Step #2* are the stuff of most therapy. They are critical skills in terms of living an authentic life. Suffice to say while Steps #1 and #2 are useful, they are not sufficient. This brings us to the third step.\n\nTo carry out this last step, you will need to identify who is \"significant\" in your life. Deep trusting relationships, folks you would catch a bullet for, your true loved ones. Make a list now \u2014 who is on your list?\n\nYour list could be two or 20 names long \u2014 the actual number doesn't matter, but it is essential that you know who is on this list (and just as important, who is not!).",

This is one of the many paradoxes required for trauma recovery. We will explore that in a bit.\n\n## Emotional Literacy\n\nAll skills require practice. Men in therapy are no exception. Twice a meeting, men in our trauma recovery groups practise deepening their emotional expression:\n\n*\"Let's hear from everyone in our opening (closing) round and 'check-in.' In a few words, tell us how you are feeling right now, at this very moment (e.g. glad, sad, mad, anxious, calm, etc.). Feelings more than thoughts.\"*\n\nThis instruction rails against the ingrained principle of responding to \"How are you?\" with a facile, socially accepted reply like, \"I'm good.\" Yet, it is on this deeper, more profound level that we must start building emotional literacy. The work of expressing emotional vulnerability is essential \u2014 a form of truth-telling you can start practising in your day-to-day life. ",

With each relationship of significance, you can assess how far you have gone in achieving *Step #3*.

However, his psychiatrist deemed him not to be insane as the pilot wanted to avoid danger \u2014 a rational desire. Indeed, the pilot, because of his sanity, had to fly more missions.\n\nA paradox involves a situation or statement that is seemingly impossible to understand because it posits two opposing propositions.

We call this deepening of relationships *Emotional Integrity (EI)*. While there are many definitions of the notion of integrity, EI focuses on matters of the heart \u2014 how we carry ourselves with \"significant \"(or important) people in our life.\n\nA simple way of understanding EI is this: matching our thoughts with our feelings and behaviours. The notion is to ensure that one \"walks the talk.\" While this is helpful, it doesn't tell us how to get there. For that, we need to dig into EI in a deeper, more profound way.\n\nThink of EI as putting emotional intelligence into action. It requires a three-step process, and for it to pay off, it must proceed in the order outlined: \n\n**Step #1: Be honest with yourself.** Easy to say, but not to do. Profound honesty. Keep in mind that many people wear blinders as to who they are, oblivious to their inner process, or how they come across to others. Radical self-acceptance is needed, much like seeing your entire image in a mirror and not turning away. As no one can judge if you are doing this yourself, you must be the final arbitrator of honesty. Fundamentally though, you cannot make any changes in your life (think trauma recovery) without succeeding in this first and primary step. Nothing in life can be achieved by shielding one's eyes.\n\n**Step #2:** Take responsibility for your feelings and behaviours. Again, easy to say, yet difficult to do. Even if you don't know what you are feeling, you have to own your behaviours and not blame them on your past, other people, etc. No longer can you say, \"she pushed my buttons\" or \"I just flipped out\" \u2014 nothing but full responsibility must be taken.

Trauma does not necessarily fade with time. \n\nThis book is for the readers who responded affirmatively to the question, \"Were you abused as a child?\" This is a *subjective* approach, which is vastly different from having met the criteria for an *operational* definition of abuse. The same delineation can be made about the term trauma as well. Remember this: abuse was something *done to you* \u2014 it is not part of who you are.

While later chapters will explore how to rebuild compassion for oneself, for now it just needs to be recognized.\n\n1. *Self-kindness (vs. self-judgement):* Being warm and understanding towards yourself with regard to suffering and pain.\n2. *A sense of shared humanity (vs. isolation):* Recognizing that suffering and personal inadequacy is part of the human experience.\n3. *Balance (vs. over-identification):* Accepting all emotions, while avoiding suppressing or exaggerating them.",

Chapter 3 will explore this connection between masculinity and emotional constriction further \u2014 the throttling of one's emotional expression due to gender coding. \n\nIn our group work, men are reminded that emotional reflection is what counts, rather than sharing their thoughts or responding in a superficial manner. Surface responses don't tell us anything meaningful, nor help you gain insight. Given that men historically haven't been encouraged to be emotionally expressive, superficiality is not that surprising. They are often brought up instead to be the silent ones. \n\nNo doubt there are times when you don't know what you feel or you can't articulate the feeling. When this occurs, take the time you need. Even an experience of emotional \"neutrality\" can be explored. It may feel like waking up from a nap. If it fits, \"calm\" might be a good label for your feelings (or thoughtful, relaxed, content, etc.).\n\nYet, being neutral may also be akin to being cut off from your feelings. In those cases, you could say you are feeling \"numb\" (or emotionless, disoriented, dissociated, etc.). The target is emotional clarity.\n\nThis is in part the purpose of emotional expression \u2014 it brings others closer. There is a certain sweetness when two people can give and receive this invitation to connect. In doing so, you can allow yourself to enter this \"truer\" aspect of relationship \u2014 and get some accompaniment on your journey as well. \n\n## The Principle Of Asking For What You Want",

And while assertiveness doesn't guarantee you will get the outcome you want, it's the best bet for success.\n\n## The Principle Of \"Fighting Fairly\"\n\nEven in relationships that value the notion of responsible assertiveness, disagreement and conflicts will still occur. With past abuse, many men tend to avoid conflict as it may spark memories of past pain. Other men may rely on conflict to get what they want. Given the need to hold yourself respectfully in situations of conflict, you may need to remind yourself that you can proceed in ways that are respectful to yourself, to other(s) and to the relationship as a whole.

          "text": "Now here's the rub. We were all vulnerable as children. All chil-dren are. And the men who were abused were harmed by people, usually people in a position of trust. This is vastly different from being a victim of a hurricane or a car crash. At its core, childhood abuse is an act of betrayal.\n\nIn many respects, it makes \"good sense\" that many survivors are wary of trusting others \u2014 be it a new neighbour, a potential friend, a possible date \u2014 given this history. Fundamentally, if a man concludes that *people = trust = betrayal = suffering*, he will shun connection with anyone who wants to get close to him.\n\nThis is bound to cause problems because people are wired for connection. We are social beings. We are pack animals. For 99% of our time on this planet, we have eked out our existence by living in small bands, organizing ourselves to eat each day and not be eaten. We had to learn skills from each other, adapt to the norms of the group, arrange safety and protection, and get our needs met. This is how we survived as a species. This is who we are and how we are bound together. \n\nWhile someone may \"instinctively\" stay clear of other people as a reaction to betrayal, this isolation prevents healing because it is the very connection with others that is the ticket to recovery.\n\nWe talk about this extensively in our therapy groups. One example comes to mind. For instance, if you read all the self-help books in the world staying in an enclosed room, would you find healing? You would know a lot more, and you could say you were more prepared to take on the work ahead, but you would not experience substantive recovery.\n\nYou *cannot* heal in isolation. You cannot be your \"true self\" in isolation either. Even though you were hurt by other people, the only way to recover is being in relation with others. ",

Once you choose who can hold space for your story, you are no longer alone on your journey to recovery. \n\nYou may note a friction in the work ahead: silence and isolation have been essential to managing your pain, but articulating your experience and finding social bonds are now going to prove essential on your path to recovery. This is one of the many paradoxes required for trauma recovery. We will explore that in a bit.\n\n## Emotional Literacy\n\nAll skills require practice. Men in therapy are no exception. Twice a meeting, men in our trauma recovery groups practise deepening their emotional expression:\n\n*\"Let's hear from everyone in our opening (closing) round and 'check-in.' In a few words, tell us how you are feeling right now, at this very moment (e.g. glad, sad, mad, anxious, calm, etc.). Feelings more than thoughts.\"*\n\nThis instruction rails against the ingrained principle of responding to \"How are you?\" with a facile, socially accepted reply like, \"I'm good.\" Yet, it is on this deeper, more profound level that we must start building emotional literacy. The work of expressing emotional vulnerability is essential \u2014 a form of truth-telling you can start practising in your day-to-day life. ",

They further hold responsibility for the climate of the group: when to dig deeper, when to shift focus, when to engage other individuals to ensure that \"talk time\" is shared and respectful. Almost all groups have guidelines around conduct. It is the therapist's job (not the group members) to ensure the group maintains safety and trust for all. \n\nGroup work provides connection with others. In many ways, it is like a laboratory to try out new awarenesses, share experiences that may be unvoiced, practise new skills of expression, vulnerability and allow for normalizing \u2014 no longer seeing oneself as the only one who went through a particular experience. By con-tributing their stories, participants will view their experiences differently.\n\nGroup therapy has been referred to as \"Triple E\" treatment: it is *equivalent* to the experience of individual therapy; it is seen as clinically *effective*, and lastly it is more *economical* than individual work.\n\nThe ideal arrangement is to consider both individual and group work concurrently as it will allow you to heal in different ways. Think of therapy as being analogous to the needs of trees. Tree roots require *depth* for sustenance \u2014 they need to go deep. This is the role of individual therapy. That therapy hour is just for you and is about you. Yet, tree roots also need to have *breadth* for stability, resourcing, and interconnection with other living things. That is the role for groups in all of its forms: facilitator-led therapy groups, peer-support groups (in which there is a group leader with the same lived experience), online support groups, and peer discussion boards. All allow for interactivity and mutual support.\n\nAllies in your healing are necessary. You can't do this work alone. \n\n## Chapter 2 Reflections",

Trauma may be a new word to consider, or it may be as familiar to you as a dirty shirt. No matter. Trauma is the present-day injury from the abuse of the past. The emphasis here is on the process of *recovery* from trauma. \n\nNot everyone who has experienced childhood abuse ends up being traumatized. Remind yourself that abuse is an inescapable event that often, but not always, overwhelms people's coping mechanisms. And the consequence of abuse can last indefinitely \u2014 years, if not decades, later. Trauma does not necessarily fade with time. \n\nThis book is for the readers who responded affirmatively to the question, \"Were you abused as a child?\" This is a *subjective* approach, which is vastly different from having met the criteria for an *operational* definition of abuse. The same delineation can be made about the term trauma as well. Remember this: abuse was something *done to you* \u2014 it is not part of who you are. A \"traumatic event\" is personal and open to interpretation. And the only expert at the end of the day is you. ",

Frankl*\n\nFor someone with unintegrated trauma, every day may seem the same. Days marked by emotional swings, endless replays, things feeling out of control yet needing to be in control. The feeling of being cut off \u2014 avoidance, numbing, and patterns of isolation. Life stuck on repeat. Living in the past. Wishing for a better future. A tenuous connection to the here-and-now.\n\nToday may be the day you start to change that. Don't feel bad that you didn't do it yesterday. Perhaps you just weren't ready then. Perhaps now you are. \n\nAt our clinic, the average age of men seeking recovery from childhood trauma is 45 years old. Given that the average age of childhood sexual abuse for boys is between nine and ten years old, men are often waiting decades before they ask for help. That's a lot of time, much of it in suffering, much of it in silence.\n\n## Breaking Silence",

Ownership of *feelings* may necessitate \"unpacking.\" Naming an emotion and acknowledging it as yours requires deep self-conscious reflection. Naming it allows you to take full responsibility to make whatever changes you wish to act on. \n\nTry to practise EI. Express how you are feeling (e.g., glad, sad, mad, scared, ashamed, etc.) without attributing external causes upon anything or anybody. No longer does your partner \"make\" you angry \u2014 the emotional state called \"anger\" stems from within you. Increasing your EI allows you to be more responsible and responsive. The people in your life will be able to understand both you and your inner process \u2014 core elements of maintaining and holding connection. \n\nThe goal is to practise *emotional granularity* \u2014 finding the precise language to communicate your felt states with others. Just like grains of sand, see if you can identify and articulate each feeling as it comes up. This is essential in *Step #1* (being honest with ourselves) as well as *Step #2* (being responsible for our behaviours and feeling states) and leads to *Step #3* (getting closer to others). \n\n*Step #1* and *Step #2* are the stuff of most therapy. They are critical skills in terms of living an authentic life. Suffice to say while Steps #1 and #2 are useful, they are not sufficient. This brings us to the third step.\n\nTo carry out this last step, you will need to identify who is \"significant\" in your life. Deep trusting relationships, folks you would catch a bullet for, your true loved ones. Make a list now \u2014 who is on your list?\n\nYour list could be two or 20 names long \u2014 the actual number doesn't matter, but it is essential that you know who is on this list (and just as important, who is not!).",

          "text": "## The Principle Of Emotional Integrity\n\nWhile emotional expression is important, it needs to be taken one step further. We call this deepening of relationships *Emotional Integrity (EI)*. While there are many definitions of the notion of integrity, EI focuses on matters of the heart \u2014 how we carry ourselves with \"significant \"(or important) people in our life.\n\nA simple way of understanding EI is this: matching our thoughts with our feelings and behaviours. The notion is to ensure that one \"walks the talk.\" While this is helpful, it doesn't tell us how to get there. For that, we need to dig into EI in a deeper, more profound way.\n\nThink of EI as putting emotional intelligence into action. It requires a three-step process, and for it to pay off, it must proceed in the order outlined: \n\n**Step #1: Be honest with yourself.** Easy to say, but not to do. Profound honesty. Keep in mind that many people wear blinders as to who they are, oblivious to their inner process, or how they come across to others. Radical self-acceptance is needed, much like seeing your entire image in a mirror and not turning away. As no one can judge if you are doing this yourself, you must be the final arbitrator of honesty. Fundamentally though, you cannot make any changes in your life (think trauma recovery) without succeeding in this first and primary step. Nothing in life can be achieved by shielding one's eyes.\n\n**Step #2:** Take responsibility for your feelings and behaviours. Again, easy to say, yet difficult to do. Even if you don't know what you are feeling, you have to own your behaviours and not blame them on your past, other people, etc. No longer can you say, \"she pushed my buttons\" or \"I just flipped out\" \u2014 nothing but full responsibility must be taken.

Indeed, the pilot, because of his sanity, had to fly more missions.\n\nA paradox involves a situation or statement that is seemingly impossible to understand because it posits two opposing propositions.

          "text": "## The Principle Of Emotional Integrity\n\nWhile emotional expression is important, it needs to be taken one step further. We call this deepening of relationships *Emotional Integrity (EI)*. While there are many definitions of the notion of integrity, EI focuses on matters of the heart \u2014 how we carry ourselves with \"significant \"(or important) people in our life.\n\nA simple way of understanding EI is this: matching our thoughts with our feelings and behaviours. The notion is to ensure that one \"walks the talk.\" While this is helpful, it doesn't tell us how to get there. For that, we need to dig into EI in a deeper, more profound way.\n\nThink of EI as putting emotional intelligence into action. It requires a three-step process, and for it to pay off, it must proceed in the order outlined: \n\n**Step #1: Be honest with yourself.** Easy to say, but not to do. Profound honesty. Keep in mind that many people wear blinders as to who they are, oblivious to their inner process, or how they come across to others. Radical self-acceptance is needed, much like seeing your entire image in a mirror and not turning away. As no one can judge if you are doing this yourself, you must be the final arbitrator of honesty. Fundamentally though, you cannot make any changes in your life (think trauma recovery) without succeeding in this first and primary step. Nothing in life can be achieved by shielding one's eyes.\n\n**Step #2:** Take responsibility for your feelings and behaviours. Again, easy to say, yet difficult to do. Even if you don't know what you are feeling, you have to own your behaviours and not blame them on your past, other people, etc. No longer can you say, \"she pushed my buttons\" or \"I just flipped out\" \u2014 nothing but full responsibility must be taken.

          "text": "## Emotional Compression\n\nStudies have shown that women have greater emotional awareness and a larger emotional lexicon than men. Researchers are unsure as to the reasons for this difference \u2014 a matter of brain wiring or socialization or both. Whereas femininity connotes being in relationship with others, masculinity suggests individualism and invulnerability. \n\nMen tend to display less emotional depth in communication, perhaps relying on women to do more of the \"emotional work.\" The advent of boys' puberty marks the beginning of constricted emotional expression between male friends. Overall, males' emotional and social richness tends to atrophy. Their range of emotional granularity (i.e., precise emotional articulation) also diminishes. \n\nBefore proceeding, let's continue to explore why we have emotions in the first place. Emotions serve as an \"early warning system\" \u2014 a way of protecting oneself physically (fear in the face of danger), interpersonally (anger reflecting a violation of boundaries) as well as strengthening emotional intimacy (guilt signals a breach of connection with others). With every emotion, there is a powerful feedback loop to ourselves and others. \n\n*Affective numbing* describes a lack of emotional awareness and expression for many men who experienced abuse as a child. It is a symptom of trauma and manifests as an inability to sense or speak about one's emotions. Affective numbing constrains many men, not only those who have been abused. \n\n*Alexithymia* is similar. Individuals with alexithymia experience emotions but have a hard time naming and expressing them. Instead, when asked about their emotions, they may describe physical symptoms or relay the events of their day instead. A somewhat  related concept is *anhedonia* \u2014 the inability to feel pleasure. While these conditions may not be directly related to a trauma response, they are experiences found most often in men.",

Chapter 3 will explore this connection between masculinity and emotional constriction further \u2014 the throttling of one's emotional expression due to gender coding. \n\nIn our group work, men are reminded that emotional reflection is what counts, rather than sharing their thoughts or responding in a superficial manner. Surface responses don't tell us anything meaningful, nor help you gain insight. Given that men historically haven't been encouraged to be emotionally expressive, superficiality is not that surprising. They are often brought up instead to be the silent ones. \n\nNo doubt there are times when you don't know what you feel or you can't articulate the feeling. When this occurs, take the time you need. Even an experience of emotional \"neutrality\" can be explored. It may feel like waking up from a nap. If it fits, \"calm\" might be a good label for your feelings (or thoughtful, relaxed, content, etc.).\n\nYet, being neutral may also be akin to being cut off from your feelings. In those cases, you could say you are feeling \"numb\" (or emotionless, disoriented, dissociated, etc.). The target is emotional clarity.\n\nThis is in part the purpose of emotional expression \u2014 it brings others closer. There is a certain sweetness when two people can give and receive this invitation to connect. In doing so, you can allow yourself to enter this \"truer\" aspect of relationship \u2014 and get some accompaniment on your journey as well. \n\n## The Principle Of Asking For What You Want",

Ownership of *feelings* may necessitate \"unpacking.\" Naming an emotion and acknowledging it as yours requires deep self-conscious reflection. Naming it allows you to take full responsibility to make whatever changes you wish to act on. \n\nTry to practise EI. Express how you are feeling (e.g., glad, sad, mad, scared, ashamed, etc.) without attributing external causes upon anything or anybody. No longer does your partner \"make\" you angry \u2014 the emotional state called \"anger\" stems from within you. Increasing your EI allows you to be more responsible and responsive. The people in your life will be able to understand both you and your inner process \u2014 core elements of maintaining and holding connection. \n\nThe goal is to practise *emotional granularity* \u2014 finding the precise language to communicate your felt states with others. Just like grains of sand, see if you can identify and articulate each feeling as it comes up. This is essential in *Step #1* (being honest with ourselves) as well as *Step #2* (being responsible for our behaviours and feeling states) and leads to *Step #3* (getting closer to others). \n\n*Step #1* and *Step #2* are the stuff of most therapy. They are critical skills in terms of living an authentic life. Suffice to say while Steps #1 and #2 are useful, they are not sufficient. This brings us to the third step.\n\nTo carry out this last step, you will need to identify who is \"significant\" in your life. Deep trusting relationships, folks you would catch a bullet for, your true loved ones. Make a list now \u2014 who is on your list?\n\nYour list could be two or 20 names long \u2014 the actual number doesn't matter, but it is essential that you know who is on this list (and just as important, who is not!).",

Trauma may be a new word to consider, or it may be as familiar to you as a dirty shirt. No matter. Trauma is the present-day injury from the abuse of the past. The emphasis here is on the process of *recovery* from trauma. \n\nNot everyone who has experienced childhood abuse ends up being traumatized. Remind yourself that abuse is an inescapable event that often, but not always, overwhelms people's coping mechanisms. And the consequence of abuse can last indefinitely \u2014 years, if not decades, later. Trauma does not necessarily fade with time. \n\nThis book is for the readers who responded affirmatively to the question, \"Were you abused as a child?\" This is a *subjective* approach, which is vastly different from having met the criteria for an *operational* definition of abuse. The same delineation can be made about the term trauma as well. Remember this: abuse was something *done to you* \u2014 it is not part of who you are. A \"traumatic event\" is personal and open to interpretation. And the only expert at the end of the day is you. ",

Partners, parents, siblings, even employers have called asking how they can get someone into therapy. The answer is simple: he must want to do the work himself.",

For the abuser, it keeps their crimes hidden \u2014 often allowing a continued pattern of offending while avoiding any recrimination or consequences. For those abused, the silence is often part of the shame response (see Chapter 11 for why shame is considered the \"master\" emotion). The need for silence is an unspoken bond (or understanding) between the two \u2014 silence being essential for the perpetrator and the only option for the victim. \n\nTo move on with your life, words need to be put to the experience. As your voice has been the second casualty of abuse, your task is to break this silence. This is not just your story. This is your life, and it needs to be restored with truth telling.\n\n## Putting Words To It\n\nYou may have lived with your experience for many years before putting words to it or seeking help.

Frankl*\n\nFor someone with unintegrated trauma, every day may seem the same. Days marked by emotional swings, endless replays, things feeling out of control yet needing to be in control. The feeling of being cut off \u2014 avoidance, numbing, and patterns of isolation. Life stuck on repeat. Living in the past. Wishing for a better future. A tenuous connection to the here-and-now.\n\nToday may be the day you start to change that. Don't feel bad that you didn't do it yesterday. Perhaps you just weren't ready then. Perhaps now you are. \n\nAt our clinic, the average age of men seeking recovery from childhood trauma is 45 years old. Given that the average age of childhood sexual abuse for boys is between nine and ten years old, men are often waiting decades before they ask for help.

Often, it must address years, if not decades, of avoidance, let alone curb or replace problematic coping mechanisms. No one can guide themselves to this place of recovery as they have never been there before. Guides are an essential part of the journey.\n\nHere is where a counsellor or therapist comes into play. While they are not the only helping relationship you may employ, their role may be critical for your recovery. They may be essential in your task of acknowledging your truth, hearing your story, and helping you acquire self-compassion. This is quite the responsibility. This level of support may be beyond what a loved one can provide. It often takes a concerned, trained and empathic \"outsider\" to help you chart your way.\n\nIf you are new to the healing process, consider finding a therapist to accompany you on this journey. Apart from learning skills and awareness of what it takes to recover from past abuse, your therapist can inject elements of trust, hope, safety and security. You no longer have to travel alone. \n\nAs the therapeutic relationship deepens over time, you may experience a deep emotional connection. This connection is restorative (a type of repair work), for you to feel unconditional regard, trust and safety \u2014 and will help undo some of the harm of the unsafe relationships you experienced when you were abused.  \n\nWhen you are shopping for a therapist, you may want to consider interviewing prospective helpers to see who can work best with you. You have the right to ask them about their experience, qualifications and approaches to working with the issues. You may also want to consider the following:",

Of course, there is a myriad of gender and sexual identities, and the intent is not to limit or exclude any individual who has experienced woundedness from childhood.

A mental health professional may use the terms *Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Complex PTSD*, or some other label; yet you are the one who truly knows. Childhood wounds can be experienced physically, sexually, or emotionally, and can include issues of neglect, coercion and bullying. These wounds are considered *developmental* trauma as they interfere with the child's psychosocial development and they may persist into adulthood. \n\nThere is no need to list all the examples of various types of childhood abuse as no one finds themselves in lists (there are many sources for types of victimization, if that is a particular learning need). As a reader, you no doubt know much of your own story. Start there. \n\nIf you are an ally (e.g., partner, friend, family member), you likely are aware of some of the person's history to know that he has experienced trauma. Details may be ex-  traneous to your role in supporting him. Let him tell you his story when he is ready. You can be his witness.\n\n## The Abuse Of Boys\n\nNo one knows how many males are *sexually* abused as children. It is estimated that about *one in six males* experiences \"contact\" sexual abuse by age 18. This figure is an average of many North American research studies. Contact sexual abuse means abuse that involves touch between the victim and the person(s) who offended them. Children and youth can also experience sexual abuse that does not involve touch, such as exposure to pornography or a parent purposely disrobing for sexual arousal. If these other noncontact forms of sexual abuse were included in this research, higher overall rates would be found. \n\nSpecific populations of males are known to have higher rates of sexual abuse. Research suggests that Indigenous men, Queer men (i.e., gay and bisexual men and trans folks), men who have been incarcerated, and men with disabilities are known to experience higher rates of childhood abuse. There is still much to learn about who is impacted by this issue and to what degree. ",

Over time, shame gets internalized in the form of self-loathing, \"loss of self,\" and feelings of insignificance, weakness or unmanliness. This prolonged exposure (known as *shame-hardening*) results in *shame-phobia* \u2014 an avoidance of activities that may result in shame. \n\nHow trauma deepens the shame response will be explored later in this book.

Often, it must address years, if not decades, of avoidance, let alone curb or replace problematic coping mechanisms. No one can guide themselves to this place of recovery as they have never been there before. Guides are an essential part of the journey.\n\nHere is where a counsellor or therapist comes into play. While they are not the only helping relationship you may employ, their role may be critical for your recovery. They may be essential in your task of acknowledging your truth, hearing your story, and helping you acquire self-compassion. This is quite the responsibility. This level of support may be beyond what a loved one can provide. It often takes a concerned, trained and empathic \"outsider\" to help you chart your way.\n\nIf you are new to the healing process, consider finding a therapist to accompany you on this journey. Apart from learning skills and awareness of what it takes to recover from past abuse, your therapist can inject elements of trust, hope, safety and security. You no longer have to travel alone. \n\nAs the therapeutic relationship deepens over time, you may experience a deep emotional connection. This connection is restorative (a type of repair work), for you to feel unconditional regard, trust and safety \u2014 and will help undo some of the harm of the unsafe relationships you experienced when you were abused.  \n\nWhen you are shopping for a therapist, you may want to consider interviewing prospective helpers to see who can work best with you.

You have the responsibility to take risks and the right to take a pass on any step in your journey ahead. \n\n**Reach out.** Find others to accompany you on this journey. This may mean involving a friend, trusted advisor, fellow travellers who are on a similar journey, perhaps even a therapist (see the next section for some guidance on how to pick one). You can\u2019t  heal in isolation.\n\n**Find community: group therapy, peer support or online engagement.** There is a Nigerian expression that attests to the strength of fellowship: \u201cOne finger cannot pick up a stone.\u201d When you have comradery with others who have a similar past, you can experience deep understanding, share your burden, become fellow role models for healing and give each other emotional support. There is strength in numbers. \n\n**Take rest stops.** Some of the journey ahead involves rough terrain, while other sections will be smooth. Adjust yourself accordingly. Take rest stops as needed.

With each relationship of significance, you can assess how far you have gone in achieving *Step #3*. With this insight, you can now consider what you can do next to close the gap and thus heighten connection and intimacy.\n\nThat is the deep work of EI \u2014 nurturing one's life and relationships to develop \"genuine\" connection with others. \n\n## Learning Through Paradox\n\nIn the novel *Catch 22*, author Joseph Heller describes the situation of a pilot in World War II seeking to be declared insane to avoid combat, given the risk of dying. However, his psychiatrist deemed him not to be insane as the pilot wanted to avoid danger \u2014 a rational desire. Indeed, the pilot, because of his sanity, had to fly more missions.\n\nA paradox involves a situation or statement that is seemingly impossible to understand because it posits two opposing propositions. While they may be overlooked in everyday life (e.g., being turned down for a car loan because you don't have enough money, but knowing you could get the loan if you had the money), the role of paradox is critical to understanding and navigating trauma and recovery.",

Despite discomfort and set-backs, it has to be faced with courage. *You have to get in to get out.* This is arguably the greatest paradox to embrace on the healing journey. \n\n## Embracing Self-Compassion\n\nNo one can be successful in recovery work without practising self-compassion. Self-compassion is a way of accepting yourself with kindness and concern. Regardless of your \"performance\" \u2014 good days and bad, strengths and weaknesses, the task is to accept your \"perfectly imperfect\" self.\n\nAlmost universally, this kindness to the self fails to exist in the daily lives of many men. While later chapters will explore how to rebuild compassion for oneself, for now it just needs to be recognized.\n\n1. *Self-kindness (vs. self-judgement):* Being warm and understanding towards yourself with regard to suffering and pain.\n2. *A sense of shared humanity (vs. isolation):* Recognizing that suffering and personal inadequacy is part of the human experience.\n3. *Balance (vs. over-identification):* Accepting all emotions, while avoiding suppressing or exaggerating them.",

Just like the importance of eating food slowly for better digestion, practise slow reading. The slower you go, the faster you may get to your destination.\n\n*Read this book in order.* \"First things first\" applies to this kind of work. The chapters are arranged like the building of a house \u2014 foundational issues come first, then the framing, the roof, and so on.\n\nDon't skip ahead. Recovery doesn't work like that.\n\n*Make four letter words count.* Two words to consider for now: risk and pass. Practise \"I'll take a risk\" in the sense of taking baby steps into the unknown of your work ahead. Nudge yourself into areas where you haven't yet gone. As well, allow yourself the right to \"take a pass\" on anything or anybody that does not feel right for you. It may not be right for now, or it may not be right at all. You have the responsibility to take risks and the right to pass on any step in your journey. \n\n*Reach out.* Find others to accompany you on this journey. This may mean involving a friend, trusted advisor, fellow travellers who are on a similar journey, perhaps even a therapist (see the next section for some guidance on how to pick one). You can't  heal in isolation.\n\n*Find community: group therapy, peer support or online engagement.* There is a Nigerian expression that attests to the strength of fellowship: \"One finger cannot pick up a stone.\" When you have comradery with others who have a similar past, you can experience deep understanding, share your burden, become fellow role models for healing and give each other emotional support.

          "text": "## The Principle Of Emotional Integrity\n\nWhile emotional expression is important, it needs to be taken one step further. We call this deepening of relationships *Emotional Integrity (EI)*. While there are many definitions of the notion of integrity, EI focuses on matters of the heart \u2014 how we carry ourselves with \"significant \"(or important) people in our life.\n\nA simple way of understanding EI is this: matching our thoughts with our feelings and behaviours. The notion is to ensure that one \"walks the talk.\" While this is helpful, it doesn't tell us how to get there. For that, we need to dig into EI in a deeper, more profound way.\n\nThink of EI as putting emotional intelligence into action. It requires a three-step process, and for it to pay off, it must proceed in the order outlined: \n\n**Step #1: Be honest with yourself.** Easy to say, but not to do. Profound honesty. Keep in mind that many people wear blinders as to who they are, oblivious to their inner process, or how they come across to others. Radical self-acceptance is needed, much like seeing your entire image in a mirror and not turning away. As no one can judge if you are doing this yourself, you must be the final arbitrator of honesty. Fundamentally though, you cannot make any changes in your life (think trauma recovery) without succeeding in this first and primary step. Nothing in life can be achieved by shielding one's eyes.\n\n**Step #2:** Take responsibility for your feelings and behaviours. Again, easy to say, yet difficult to do. Even if you don't know what you are feeling, you have to own your behaviours and not blame them on your past, other people, etc. No longer can you say, \"she pushed my buttons\" or \"I just flipped out\" \u2014 nothing but full responsibility must be taken.

It is not a linear process that can be intellectualized.

Ownership of *feelings* may necessitate \"unpacking.\" Naming an emotion and acknowledging it as yours requires deep self-conscious reflection. Naming it allows you to take full responsibility to make whatever changes you wish to act on. \n\nTry to practise EI. Express how you are feeling (e.g., glad, sad, mad, scared, ashamed, etc.) without attributing external causes upon anything or anybody. No longer does your partner \"make\" you angry \u2014 the emotional state called \"anger\" stems from within you. Increasing your EI allows you to be more responsible and responsive. The people in your life will be able to understand both you and your inner process \u2014 core elements of maintaining and holding connection. \n\nThe goal is to practise *emotional granularity* \u2014 finding the precise language to communicate your felt states with others. Just like grains of sand, see if you can identify and articulate each feeling as it comes up. This is essential in *Step #1* (being honest with ourselves) as well as *Step #2* (being responsible for our behaviours and feeling states) and leads to *Step #3* (getting closer to others). \n\n*Step #1* and *Step #2* are the stuff of most therapy. They are critical skills in terms of living an authentic life. Suffice to say while Steps #1 and #2 are useful, they are not sufficient. This brings us to the third step.\n\nTo carry out this last step, you will need to identify who is \"significant\" in your life. Deep trusting relationships, folks you would catch a bullet for, your true loved ones. Make a list now \u2014 who is on your list?\n\nYour list could be two or 20 names long \u2014 the actual number doesn't matter, but it is essential that you know who is on this list (and just as important, who is not!).",

They further hold responsibility for the climate of the group: when to dig deeper, when to shift focus, when to engage other individuals to ensure that \"talk time\" is shared and respectful. Almost all groups have guidelines around conduct. It is the therapist's job (not the group members) to ensure the group maintains safety and trust for all. \n\nGroup work provides connection with others. In many ways, it is like a laboratory to try out new awarenesses, share experiences that may be unvoiced, practise new skills of expression, vulnerability and allow for normalizing \u2014 no longer seeing oneself as the only one who went through a particular experience. By con-tributing their stories, participants will view their experiences differently.\n\nGroup therapy has been referred to as \"Triple E\" treatment: it is *equivalent* to the experience of individual therapy; it is seen as clinically *effective*, and lastly it is more *economical* than individual work.\n\nThe ideal arrangement is to consider both individual and group work concurrently as it will allow you to heal in different ways. Think of therapy as being analogous to the needs of trees. Tree roots require *depth* for sustenance \u2014 they need to go deep. This is the role of individual therapy. That therapy hour is just for you and is about you. Yet, tree roots also need to have *breadth* for stability, resourcing, and interconnection with other living things. That is the role for groups in all of its forms: facilitator-led therapy groups, peer-support groups (in which there is a group leader with the same lived experience), online support groups, and peer discussion boards. All allow for interactivity and mutual support.\n\nAllies in your healing are necessary. You can't do this work alone. \n\n## Chapter 2 Reflections",

Now that I can talk about it more comfortably, I believe healing is happening now.*\n\n*always seem to say things like \"what happened to me\" or \"the stuff I went through.\" I have a really hard time with the terminology. Back then he called it \"playing around.\" That's why it seemed, on some level, acceptable.*",

For the abuser, it keeps their crimes hidden \u2014 often allowing a continued pattern of offending while avoiding any recrimination or consequences.

Contact sexual abuse means abuse that involves touch between the victim and the person(s) who offended them.

Trauma may be a new word to consider, or it may be as familiar to you as a dirty shirt. No matter. Trauma is the present-day injury from the abuse of the past. The emphasis here is on the process of recovery from trauma. \n\nNot everyone who has experienced childhood abuse ends up being traumatized. Remind yourself that abuse is an inescapable event that often, but not always, overwhelms people\u2019s coping mechanisms. And the consequence of abuse can last indefinitely \u2014 years, if not decades, later. Trauma does not necessarily fade with time. \n\nThis book is for the readers who responded affirmatively to the question, \u201cWere you abused as a child?\u201d This is a *subjective* approach, which is vastly different from having met the criteria for an *operational* definition of abuse. The same delineation can be made about the term trauma as well. Remember this: abuse was something *done to you* \u2014 it is not part of who you are. A \u201ctraumatic event\u201d is personal and open to interpretation. And the only expert at the end of the day is you. ",

The feeling of being cut off \u2014 avoidance, numbing, and patterns of isolation. Life stuck on repeat. Living in the past. Wishing for a better future. A tenuous connection to the here-and-now.\n\nToday may be the day you start to change that. Don't feel bad that you didn't do it yesterday. Perhaps you just weren't ready then. Perhaps now you are. \n\nAt our clinic, the average age of men seeking recovery from childhood trauma is 45 years old.

Imagination allows for possibilities \u2014 it is the call of the daring.

Trauma may be a new word to consider, or it may be as familiar to you as a dirty shirt. No matter. Trauma is the present-day injury from the abuse of the past. The emphasis here is on the process of *recovery* from trauma. \n\nNot everyone who has experienced childhood abuse ends up being traumatized. Remind yourself that abuse is an inescapable event that often, but not always, overwhelms people's coping mechanisms. And the consequence of abuse can last indefinitely \u2014 years, if not decades, later. Trauma does not necessarily fade with time. \n\nThis book is for the readers who responded affirmatively to the question, \"Were you abused as a child?\" This is a *subjective* approach, which is vastly different from having met the criteria for an *operational* definition of abuse. The same delineation can be made about the term trauma as well. Remember this: abuse was something *done to you* \u2014 it is not part of who you are. A \"traumatic event\" is personal and open to interpretation. And the only expert at the end of the day is you. ",

This is one of the many paradoxes required for trauma recovery. We will explore that in a bit.\n\n## Emotional Literacy\n\nAll skills require practice. Men in therapy are no exception. Twice a meeting, men in our trauma recovery groups practise deepening their emotional expression:\n\n*\"Let's hear from everyone in our opening (closing) round and 'check-in.' In a few words, tell us how you are feeling right now, at this very moment (e.g. glad, sad, mad, anxious, calm, etc.). Feelings more than thoughts.\"*\n\nThis instruction rails against the ingrained principle of responding to \"How are you?\" with a facile, socially accepted reply like, \"I'm good.\" Yet, it is on this deeper, more profound level that we must start building emotional literacy.

A man may believe that as a husband or father he must not only put bread on the table, but must provide his family with shiny things \u2014 possibly things he never had when he was growing up. He may believe that being a good provider is paramount. By holding such a value, he may end up working so much that his relationships with his loved ones suffer. One day, he may find that his partner or children walk out on him as he has become a \"workaholic\" and neglected his family.\n\nOther consequences of Dysfunction Strain include: sexual compulsions, substance abuse, high-risk behaviour, absentee fathering, failure to share the \"emotional work\" in relationships, health problems and proneness to sexual coercion and aggression. \n\nThese three strains produce wounds that are often overlooked by society, and may go unrecognized by the individual male as it is seen as something to be expected. The cost of living with these strains is significant and includes relational discord, absent or poor fathering, risky behaviours and aggression. \n\nArguably all men, to various degrees, experience the painful shadow of masculinity. This state is not dependent of childhood abuse; rather, this is the lived reality of men in general. It's as if masculinity facilitates inadequacy, leaving many feeling empty in unfulfilling roles with consequences that may hold a similar weight like past abuse. Men may end up hurt and stifled and may cause the same pain for those around them. \n\n## The Social Construction Of Masculinity \n\nMasculinity is often measured by performance, an achievement that has only short-term effects. The \"big man,\" the top athlete, the rich guy, the player, the bully \u2014 must display their masculinity on a regular basis or they will lose their relative power. \"Men got to do, if men want to be.\"",

Experience working with women does not necessarily translate into the same abilities *working with men*. Ask them about their knowledge, comfort and experience working with male clients. Don't overlook this aspect of care. \n\n3. Given the longer-term nature of trauma therapy, you need to determine whether the cost is *affordable*. Some therapists and agencies offer sliding fee scales depending on the client's income. Group therapy is also an option as it is more economical than individual therapy. \n\n4. Having a therapist with whom you feel comfortable, heard and who can challenge you is also key. You may also prefer one gender or another. Its important to find the right *click.*\n\nHere is another angle to consider: group therapy. Being in a group of other folks working on recovery, particularly men, may be helpful. You may learn as much from your \"fellow travellers\" as from the group therapist (often called a *facilitator*). You will meet other people who are dealing with similar problems, share ideas, as well as exchange emotional support. ",

Often, it must address years, if not decades, of avoidance, let alone curb or replace problematic coping mechanisms. No one can guide themselves to this place of recovery as they have never been there before. Guides are an essential part of the journey.\n\nHere is where a counsellor or therapist comes into play. While they are not the only helping relationship you may employ, their role may be critical for your recovery. They may be essential in your task of acknowledging your truth, hearing your story, and helping you acquire self-compassion. This is quite the responsibility. This level of support may be beyond what a loved one can provide. It often takes a concerned, trained and empathic \"outsider\" to help you chart your way.\n\nIf you are new to the healing process, consider finding a therapist to accompany you on this journey. Apart from learning skills and awareness of what it takes to recover from past abuse, your therapist can inject elements of trust, hope, safety and security. You no longer have to travel alone. \n\nAs the therapeutic relationship deepens over time, you may experience a deep emotional connection. This connection is restorative (a type of repair work), for you to feel unconditional regard, trust and safety \u2014 and will help undo some of the harm of the unsafe relationships you experienced when you were abused.  \n\nWhen you are shopping for a therapist, you may want to consider interviewing prospective helpers to see who can work best with you. You have the right to ask them about their experience, qualifications and approaches to working with the issues. You may also want to consider the following:",

Often, it must address years, if not decades, of avoidance, let alone curb or replace problematic coping mechanisms. No one can guide themselves to this place of recovery as they have never been there before. Guides are an essential part of the journey.\n\nHere is where a counsellor or therapist comes into play. While they are not the only helping relationship you may employ, their role may be critical for your recovery. They may be essential in your task of acknowledging your truth, hearing your story, and helping you acquire self-compassion. This is quite the responsibility. This level of support may be beyond what a loved one can provide. It often takes a concerned, trained and empathic \"outsider\" to help you chart your way.\n\nIf you are new to the healing process, consider finding a therapist to accompany you on this journey. Apart from learning skills and awareness of what it takes to recover from past abuse, your therapist can inject elements of trust, hope, safety and security. You no longer have to travel alone. \n\nAs the therapeutic relationship deepens over time, you may experience a deep emotional connection. This connection is restorative (a type of repair work), for you to feel unconditional regard, trust and safety \u2014 and will help undo some of the harm of the unsafe relationships you experienced when you were abused.  \n\nWhen you are shopping for a therapist, you may want to consider interviewing prospective helpers to see who can work best with you. You have the right to ask them about their experience, qualifications and approaches to working with the issues. You may also want to consider the following:",

The feeling of being cut off \u2014 avoidance, numbing, and patterns of isolation. Life stuck on repeat. Living in the past. Wishing for a better future. A tenuous connection to the here-and-now.\n\nToday may be the day you start to change that. Don't feel bad that you didn't do it yesterday. Perhaps you just weren't ready then. Perhaps now you are. \n\nAt our clinic, the average age of men seeking recovery from childhood trauma is 45 years old. Given that the average age of childhood sexual abuse for boys is between nine and ten years old, men are often waiting decades before they ask for help.

Don't be put off by this word. Many men struggle with the thought of telling their family or friends about their past abuse. Without taking this third step, they would continue to live in isolation. Choosing emotional intimacy opens up the potential of untold riches in understanding, support, and expressions of love. \n\nWhile it may be challenging for folks of all genders, this third step is no doubt harder for men due to conventional masculine codes of behaviour that keep them distant from others (see Chapter 3 on how masculinity impacts our connection with others). \n\nEI may be especially hard for many survivors due to problems in developing trusting relationships with others.

Answer the question on page 9: *Suppose your goals for recovery were met tonight as you slept, how would your life be different when you awoke (e.g., What would be the first thing you noticed? How would you be thinking and feeling differently? What might others observe)?*\n\n## Fellow Traveller Quotes\n\n*It is a process. I feel as if I literally have to start from the beginning and discover who I am. Given my past, it's not a surprise.*",

This work won't be easy, so keep your eyes on the prize. \n\n*Play the long game.* The journey of recovery is long haul work; it cannot be rushed. The river cannot be pushed. Stay focused, treat your body well, practise self-compassion, and moderate your drinking, drugging or other related \"go-to\" coping mechanisms. This will help keep you strong for the journey. \n\n*Put yourself in the driver's seat.* Trauma recovery doesn't happen to you; you make it happen. Active reflection on insights that come to you (e.g., in your journal) is certainly useful, and you will also have to make incremental changes to the parts of your life that are no longer working for you.",

The same delineation can be made about the term trauma as well. Remember this: abuse was something *done to you* \u2014 it is not part of who you are. A \"traumatic event\" is personal and open to interpretation. And the only expert at the end of the day is you. ",

          "text": "Now here's the rub. We were all vulnerable as children. All chil-dren are. And the men who were abused were harmed by people, usually people in a position of trust. This is vastly different from being a victim of a hurricane or a car crash. At its core, childhood abuse is an act of betrayal.\n\nIn many respects, it makes \"good sense\" that many survivors are wary of trusting others \u2014 be it a new neighbour, a potential friend, a possible date \u2014 given this history. Fundamentally, if a man concludes that *people = trust = betrayal = suffering*, he will shun connection with anyone who wants to get close to him.\n\nThis is bound to cause problems because people are wired for connection. We are social beings. We are pack animals. For 99% of our time on this planet, we have eked out our existence by living in small bands, organizing ourselves to eat each day and not be eaten. We had to learn skills from each other, adapt to the norms of the group, arrange safety and protection, and get our needs met. This is how we survived as a species. This is who we are and how we are bound together. \n\nWhile someone may \"instinctively\" stay clear of other people as a reaction to betrayal, this isolation prevents healing because it is the very connection with others that is the ticket to recovery.\n\nWe talk about this extensively in our therapy groups. One example comes to mind. For instance, if you read all the self-help books in the world staying in an enclosed room, would you find healing? You would know a lot more, and you could say you were more prepared to take on the work ahead, but you would not experience substantive recovery.\n\nYou *cannot* heal in isolation. You cannot be your \"true self\" in isolation either. Even though you were hurt by other people, the only way to recover is being in relation with others. ",

Often, it must address years, if not decades, of avoidance, let alone curb or replace problematic coping mechanisms. No one can guide themselves to this place of recovery as they have never been there before. Guides are an essential part of the journey.\n\nHere is where a counsellor or therapist comes into play. While they are not the only helping relationship you may employ, their role may be critical for your recovery. They may be essential in your task of acknowledging your truth, hearing your story, and helping you acquire self-compassion. This is quite the responsibility. This level of support may be beyond what a loved one can provide. It often takes a concerned, trained and empathic \"outsider\" to help you chart your way.\n\nIf you are new to the healing process, consider finding a therapist to accompany you on this journey. Apart from learning skills and awareness of what it takes to recover from past abuse, your therapist can inject elements of trust, hope, safety and security. You no longer have to travel alone. \n\nAs the therapeutic relationship deepens over time, you may experience a deep emotional connection. This connection is restorative (a type of repair work), for you to feel unconditional regard, trust and safety \u2014 and will help undo some of the harm of the unsafe relationships you experienced when you were abused.  \n\nWhen you are shopping for a therapist, you may want to consider interviewing prospective helpers to see who can work best with you. You have the right to ask them about their experience, qualifications and approaches to working with the issues. You may also want to consider the following:",

This is one of the many paradoxes required for trauma recovery. We will explore that in a bit.\n\n## Emotional Literacy\n\nAll skills require practice. Men in therapy are no exception. Twice a meeting, men in our trauma recovery groups practise deepening their emotional expression:\n\n*\"Let's hear from everyone in our opening (closing) round and 'check-in.' In a few words, tell us how you are feeling right now, at this very moment (e.g. glad, sad, mad, anxious, calm, etc.). Feelings more than thoughts.\"*\n\nThis instruction rails against the ingrained principle of responding to \"How are you?\" with a facile, socially accepted reply like, \"I'm good.\" Yet, it is on this deeper, more profound level that we must start building emotional literacy. The work of expressing emotional vulnerability is essential \u2014 a form of truth-telling you can start practising in your day-to-day life. ",

Once you choose who can hold space for your story, you are no longer alone on your journey to recovery. \n\nYou may note a friction in the work ahead: silence and isolation have been essential to managing your pain, but articulating your experience and finding social bonds are now going to prove essential on your path to recovery. This is one of the many paradoxes required for trauma recovery. We will explore that in a bit.\n\n## Emotional Literacy\n\nAll skills require practice. Men in therapy are no exception. Twice a meeting, men in our trauma recovery groups practise deepening their emotional expression:\n\n*\"Let's hear from everyone in our opening (closing) round and 'check-in.' In a few words, tell us how you are feeling right now, at this very moment (e.g. glad, sad, mad, anxious, calm, etc.). Feelings more than thoughts.\"*\n\nThis instruction rails against the ingrained principle of responding to \"How are you?\" with a facile, socially accepted reply like, \"I'm good.\" Yet, it is on this deeper, more profound level that we must start building emotional literacy. The work of expressing emotional vulnerability is essential \u2014 a form of truth-telling you can start practising in your day-to-day life. ",

It is not a linear process that can be intellectualized. Instead of escaping the pain of your body, mind and soul, you need to lean into the pain in a manageable way, not avoid it (see Chapter 9 for how this can be done). ",

Often, it must address years, if not decades, of avoidance, let alone curb or replace problematic coping mechanisms. No one can guide themselves to this place of recovery as they have never been there before. Guides are an essential part of the journey.\n\nHere is where a counsellor or therapist comes into play. While they are not the only helping relationship you may employ, their role may be critical for your recovery. They may be essential in your task of acknowledging your truth, hearing your story, and helping you acquire self-compassion. This is quite the responsibility. This level of support may be beyond what a loved one can provide. It often takes a concerned, trained and empathic \"outsider\" to help you chart your way.\n\nIf you are new to the healing process, consider finding a therapist to accompany you on this journey. Apart from learning skills and awareness of what it takes to recover from past abuse, your therapist can inject elements of trust, hope, safety and security. You no longer have to travel alone. \n\nAs the therapeutic relationship deepens over time, you may experience a deep emotional connection. This connection is restorative (a type of repair work), for you to feel unconditional regard, trust and safety \u2014 and will help undo some of the harm of the unsafe relationships you experienced when you were abused.  \n\nWhen you are shopping for a therapist, you may want to consider interviewing prospective helpers to see who can work best with you. You have the right to ask them about their experience, qualifications and approaches to working with the issues. You may also want to consider the following:",

Self-compassion is a way of accepting yourself with kindness and concern.

They further hold responsibility for the climate of the group: when to dig deeper, when to shift focus, when to engage other individuals to ensure that \"talk time\" is shared and respectful. Almost all groups have guidelines around conduct. It is the therapist's job (not the group members) to ensure the group maintains safety and trust for all. \n\nGroup work provides connection with others. In many ways, it is like a laboratory to try out new awarenesses, share experiences that may be unvoiced, practise new skills of expression, vulnerability and allow for normalizing \u2014 no longer seeing oneself as the only one who went through a particular experience. By con-tributing their stories, participants will view their experiences differently.\n\nGroup therapy has been referred to as \"Triple E\" treatment: it is *equivalent* to the experience of individual therapy; it is seen as clinically *effective*, and lastly it is more *economical* than individual work.\n\nThe ideal arrangement is to consider both individual and group work concurrently as it will allow you to heal in different ways. Think of therapy as being analogous to the needs of trees. Tree roots require *depth* for sustenance \u2014 they need to go deep. This is the role of individual therapy. That therapy hour is just for you and is about you. Yet, tree roots also need to have *breadth* for stability, resourcing, and interconnection with other living things. That is the role for groups in all of its forms: facilitator-led therapy groups, peer-support groups (in which there is a group leader with the same lived experience), online support groups, and peer discussion boards. All allow for interactivity and mutual support.\n\nAllies in your healing are necessary. You can't do this work alone. \n\n## Chapter 2 Reflections",

Trauma may be a new word to consider, or it may be as familiar to you as a dirty shirt. No matter. Trauma is the present-day injury from the abuse of the past. The emphasis here is on the process of *recovery* from trauma. \n\nNot everyone who has experienced childhood abuse ends up being traumatized. Remind yourself that abuse is an inescapable event that often, but not always, overwhelms people's coping mechanisms. And the consequence of abuse can last indefinitely \u2014 years, if not decades, later. Trauma does not necessarily fade with time. \n\nThis book is for the readers who responded affirmatively to the question, \"Were you abused as a child?\" This is a *subjective* approach, which is vastly different from having met the criteria for an *operational* definition of abuse. The same delineation can be made about the term trauma as well. Remember this: abuse was something *done to you* \u2014 it is not part of who you are. A \"traumatic event\" is personal and open to interpretation. And the only expert at the end of the day is you. ",

Researchers are unsure as to the reasons for this difference \u2014 a matter of brain wiring or socialization or both. Whereas femininity connotes being in relationship with others, masculinity suggests individualism and invulnerability. \n\nMen tend to display less emotional depth in communication, perhaps relying on women to do more of the \"emotional work.\" The advent of boys' puberty marks the beginning of constricted emotional expression between male friends. Overall, males' emotional and social richness tends to atrophy. Their range of emotional granularity (i.e., precise emotional articulation) also diminishes. \n\nBefore proceeding, let's continue to explore why we have emotions in the first place. Emotions serve as an \"early warning system\" \u2014 a way of protecting oneself physically (fear in the face of danger), interpersonally (anger reflecting a violation of boundaries) as well as strengthening emotional intimacy (guilt signals a breach of connection with others). With every emotion, there is a powerful feedback loop to ourselves and others. \n\n*Affective numbing* describes a lack of emotional awareness and expression for many men who experienced abuse as a child. It is a symptom of trauma and manifests as an inability to sense or speak about one's emotions. Affective numbing constrains many men, not only those who have been abused. \n\n*Alexithymia* is similar. Individuals with alexithymia experience emotions but have a hard time naming and expressing them. Instead, when asked about their emotions, they may describe physical symptoms or relay the events of their day instead. A somewhat  related concept is *anhedonia* \u2014 the inability to feel pleasure. While these conditions may not be directly related to a trauma response, they are experiences found most often in men.",

It doesn't help that men, let alone society, don't often seek open discussions on men's mental health. Men, more often than not, just don't want to talk about it. \n\nI want you to consider a term that may be new to you: trauma load. A trauma load refers to your accumulated wounds from childhood, as well as adult experiences of being wounded, including experiences that are known as *revictimization*.\n\nYour trauma load isn't as simple as counting the number of times you were abused. Sometimes, a man who was abused once by someone who be-trayed his trust may experience a heavier trauma load and may have more problems than a man who was repeatedly abused by an acquaintance. \n\nPeople are different. Trauma is tricky.\n\nResearch has shown that many factors can affect the extent of trauma in a man's life:",

          "text": "## The Principle Of Emotional Integrity\n\nWhile emotional expression is important, it needs to be taken one step further. We call this deepening of relationships *Emotional Integrity (EI)*. While there are many definitions of the notion of integrity, EI focuses on matters of the heart \u2014 how we carry ourselves with \"significant \"(or important) people in our life.\n\nA simple way of understanding EI is this: matching our thoughts with our feelings and behaviours. The notion is to ensure that one \"walks the talk.\" While this is helpful, it doesn't tell us how to get there. For that, we need to dig into EI in a deeper, more profound way.\n\nThink of EI as putting emotional intelligence into action. It requires a three-step process, and for it to pay off, it must proceed in the order outlined: \n\n**Step #1: Be honest with yourself.** Easy to say, but not to do. Profound honesty. Keep in mind that many people wear blinders as to who they are, oblivious to their inner process, or how they come across to others. Radical self-acceptance is needed, much like seeing your entire image in a mirror and not turning away. As no one can judge if you are doing this yourself, you must be the final arbitrator of honesty. Fundamentally though, you cannot make any changes in your life (think trauma recovery) without succeeding in this first and primary step. Nothing in life can be achieved by shielding one's eyes.\n\n**Step #2:** Take responsibility for your feelings and behaviours. Again, easy to say, yet difficult to do. Even if you don't know what you are feeling, you have to own your behaviours and not blame them on your past, other people, etc. No longer can you say, \"she pushed my buttons\" or \"I just flipped out\" \u2014 nothing but full responsibility must be taken.

Try to envision a picture of your destination and what it would feel like to arrive. Your imagination, along with knowledge, will get you to the finish line. Imagination allows for possibilities \u2014 it is the call of the daring. Let it become your North Star.\n\n## About Childhood Wounds\n\nThis book focuses on the *response to trauma* \u2014 the overwhelming experience that past events have had on your life. Trauma may be a new word to consider, or it may be as familiar to you as a dirty shirt. No matter. Trauma is the present-day injury from the abuse of the past. The emphasis here is on the process of recovery from trauma. \n\nNot everyone who has experienced childhood abuse ends up being traumatized. Remind yourself that abuse is an inescapable event that often, but not always, overwhelms people\u2019s coping mechanisms. And the consequence of abuse can last indefinitely \u2014 years, if not decades, later. Trauma does not necessarily fade with time. \n\nThis book is for the readers who responded affirmatively to the question, \u201cWere you abused as a child?\u201d This is a *subjective* approach, which is vastly different from having met the criteria for an *operational* definition of abuse. The same delineation can be made about the term trauma as well. Remember this: abuse was something *done to you* \u2014 it is not part of who you are. A \u201ctraumatic event\u201d is personal and open to interpretation. And the only expert at the end of the day is you. ",

This is one of the many paradoxes required for trauma recovery. We will explore that in a bit.\n\n## Emotional Literacy\n\nAll skills require practice. Men in therapy are no exception. Twice a meeting, men in our trauma recovery groups practise deepening their emotional expression:\n\n*\"Let's hear from everyone in our opening (closing) round and 'check-in.' In a few words, tell us how you are feeling right now, at this very moment (e.g. glad, sad, mad, anxious, calm, etc.).

Chapter 3 will explore this connection between masculinity and emotional constriction further \u2014 the throttling of one's emotional expression due to gender coding. \n\nIn our group work, men are reminded that emotional reflection is what counts, rather than sharing their thoughts or responding in a superficial manner. Surface responses don't tell us anything meaningful, nor help you gain insight. Given that men historically haven't been encouraged to be emotionally expressive, superficiality is not that surprising. They are often brought up instead to be the silent ones. \n\nNo doubt there are times when you don't know what you feel or you can't articulate the feeling. When this occurs, take the time you need. Even an experience of emotional \"neutrality\" can be explored. It may feel like waking up from a nap. If it fits, \"calm\" might be a good label for your feelings (or thoughtful, relaxed, content, etc.).\n\nYet, being neutral may also be akin to being cut off from your feelings. In those cases, you could say you are feeling \"numb\" (or emotionless, disoriented, dissociated, etc.). The target is emotional clarity.\n\nThis is in part the purpose of emotional expression \u2014 it brings others closer. There is a certain sweetness when two people can give and receive this invitation to connect.

Researchers are unsure as to the reasons for this difference \u2014 a matter of brain wiring or socialization or both. Whereas femininity connotes being in relationship with others, masculinity suggests individualism and invulnerability. \n\nMen tend to display less emotional depth in communication, perhaps relying on women to do more of the \"emotional work.\" The advent of boys' puberty marks the beginning of constricted emotional expression between male friends. Overall, males' emotional and social richness tends to atrophy. Their range of emotional granularity (i.e., precise emotional articulation) also diminishes. \n\nBefore proceeding, let's continue to explore why we have emotions in the first place. Emotions serve as an \"early warning system\" \u2014 a way of protecting oneself physically (fear in the face of danger), interpersonally (anger reflecting a violation of boundaries) as well as strengthening emotional intimacy (guilt signals a breach of connection with others). With every emotion, there is a powerful feedback loop to ourselves and others. \n\n*Affective numbing* describes a lack of emotional awareness and expression for many men who experienced abuse as a child. It is a symptom of trauma and manifests as an inability to sense or speak about one's emotions. Affective numbing constrains many men, not only those who have been abused. \n\n*Alexithymia* is similar. Individuals with alexithymia experience emotions but have a hard time naming and expressing them. Instead, when asked about their emotions, they may describe physical symptoms or relay the events of their day instead. A somewhat  related concept is *anhedonia* \u2014 the inability to feel pleasure. While these conditions may not be directly related to a trauma response, they are experiences found most often in men.",

The second comes from the abuse itself. \n\nPast abuse typically leads to three \"pathways\" for wounded men:\n\n**1) Resignation.** You have experienced fear and vulnerability, but the world tells you that if you're scared and vulnerable, you are not a man. You resign yourself to this ambiguous state of being. You can't identify as masculine because you see yourself as \"weak.\" Emotional isolation is often a result. This could be characterized as living a \"small life\" \u2014 functioning well below one's potential. \n\n**2) Avoidance.** You think you were never abused, or believe that what happened to you did not affect you, or just made you tougher. You are not weak. You were never weak. And if anyone suggests that you are weak, you want to strike back. You can't handle other people being vulnerable either. You are the living essence of masculinity \u2014 what could be called hyper-masculinity. In fact, there is no part of you that is anything but masculine. The cost of taking on this adversarial role with the world may escape you. \n\n**3) Struggle.** You experience that same conflict of \"vulnerability versus masculinity,\" but do not resign to it. Instead, you fight the fact that you feel \"less than,\" that you feel you don't measure up to the impossible standards of gender. Similarly, you don't avoid or deny your pain. In time, you begin to question what the world is telling you about what it means to be a man \u2014 and chafe against much of the Male Code. All to say, you struggle.\n\nIf you are a man and you are reading this book in light of your own past, the third pathway, \"struggle,\" may best depict you because you are acknowledging the wounds you carry. However, you may have lived much of your life in resignation or avoidance, exhausted those pathways, and come to struggle only recently.

They should have \"power over\" others, especially over women. They should be sexually powerful. They should not be victims.\n\nThe perks of power are many, including material comfort and greater selection of sexual partners. However, the downside is that most men are left behind. They may feel \"less than\" because they compare themselves to an unattainable ideal. A chronic sense of failure is often the result, accompanied by harsh self-talk that may be unrelenting.\n\n### #3: Give'em Hell\n\nMen should be forceful and aggressive with others, particularly with other men. They should see life as a battlefield. They should be competitive and fearless. \"Winning isn't the main thing, it's the only thing.\"\n\nThis notion also has its costs particularly with regard to violence. While men inflict more injuries on others than women, they are also the majority of victims of homicide, assault and robbery. Many men lose aspects of compassion, empathy and being \"other-oriented,\" particularly in times of stress and perceived conflict. Overall, men are more likely to be diagnosed with being anti-social and narcissistic. Men fill our jails.\n\nNext are the codes that were originally referred to as \"no sissy stuff,\" as they pertain to gender role division and sexual orientation.

Frankl*\n\nFor someone with unintegrated trauma, every day may seem the same. Days marked by emotional swings, endless replays, things feeling out of control yet needing to be in control. The feeling of being cut off \u2014 avoidance, numbing, and patterns of isolation. Life stuck on repeat. Living in the past. Wishing for a better future. A tenuous connection to the here-and-now.\n\nToday may be the day you start to change that. Don't feel bad that you didn't do it yesterday. Perhaps you just weren't ready then. Perhaps now you are. \n\nAt our clinic, the average age of men seeking recovery from childhood trauma is 45 years old. Given that the average age of childhood sexual abuse for boys is between nine and ten years old, men are often waiting decades before they ask for help.

Researchers are unsure as to the reasons for this difference \u2014 a matter of brain wiring or socialization or both. Whereas femininity connotes being in relationship with others, masculinity suggests individualism and invulnerability. \n\nMen tend to display less emotional depth in communication, perhaps relying on women to do more of the \"emotional work.\" The advent of boys' puberty marks the beginning of constricted emotional expression between male friends. Overall, males' emotional and social richness tends to atrophy. Their range of emotional granularity (i.e., precise emotional articulation) also diminishes. \n\nBefore proceeding, let's continue to explore why we have emotions in the first place. Emotions serve as an \"early warning system\" \u2014 a way of protecting oneself physically (fear in the face of danger), interpersonally (anger reflecting a violation of boundaries) as well as strengthening emotional intimacy (guilt signals a breach of connection with others). With every emotion, there is a powerful feedback loop to ourselves and others. \n\n*Affective numbing* describes a lack of emotional awareness and expression for many men who experienced abuse as a child. It is a symptom of trauma and manifests as an inability to sense or speak about one's emotions. Affective numbing constrains many men, not only those who have been abused. \n\n*Alexithymia* is similar. Individuals with alexithymia experience emotions but have a hard time naming and expressing them. Instead, when asked about their emotions, they may describe physical symptoms or relay the events of their day instead. A somewhat  related concept is *anhedonia* \u2014 the inability to feel pleasure. While these conditions may not be directly related to a trauma response, they are experiences found most often in men.",

Indeed, the pilot, because of his sanity, had to fly more missions.\n\nA paradox involves a situation or statement that is seemingly impossible to understand because it posits two opposing propositions.

Trauma may be a new word to consider, or it may be as familiar to you as a dirty shirt. No matter. Trauma is the present-day injury from the abuse of the past. The emphasis here is on the process of recovery from trauma. \n\nNot everyone who has experienced childhood abuse ends up being traumatized. Remind yourself that abuse is an inescapable event that often, but not always, overwhelms people\u2019s coping mechanisms. And the consequence of abuse can last indefinitely \u2014 years, if not decades, later. Trauma does not necessarily fade with time. \n\nThis book is for the readers who responded affirmatively to the question, \u201cWere you abused as a child?\u201d This is a *subjective* approach, which is vastly different from having met the criteria for an *operational* definition of abuse. The same delineation can be made about the term trauma as well. Remember this: abuse was something *done to you* \u2014 it is not part of who you are. A \u201ctraumatic event\u201d is personal and open to interpretation. And the only expert at the end of the day is you. ",

Frankl*\n\nFor someone with unintegrated trauma, every day may seem the same. Days marked by emotional swings, endless replays, things feeling out of control yet needing to be in control. The feeling of being cut off \u2014 avoidance, numbing, and patterns of isolation. Life stuck on repeat. Living in the past. Wishing for a better future. A tenuous connection to the here-and-now.\n\nToday may be the day you start to change that. Don't feel bad that you didn't do it yesterday. Perhaps you just weren't ready then. Perhaps now you are. \n\nAt our clinic, the average age of men seeking recovery from childhood trauma is 45 years old. Given that the average age of childhood sexual abuse for boys is between nine and ten years old, men are often waiting decades before they ask for help. That's a lot of time, much of it in suffering, much of it in silence.\n\n## Breaking Silence",

          "text": "## Emotional Compression\n\nStudies have shown that women have greater emotional awareness and a larger emotional lexicon than men. Researchers are unsure as to the reasons for this difference \u2014 a matter of brain wiring or socialization or both. Whereas femininity connotes being in relationship with others, masculinity suggests individualism and invulnerability. \n\nMen tend to display less emotional depth in communication, perhaps relying on women to do more of the \"emotional work.\" The advent of boys' puberty marks the beginning of constricted emotional expression between male friends. Overall, males' emotional and social richness tends to atrophy. Their range of emotional granularity (i.e., precise emotional articulation) also diminishes. \n\nBefore proceeding, let's continue to explore why we have emotions in the first place. Emotions serve as an \"early warning system\" \u2014 a way of protecting oneself physically (fear in the face of danger), interpersonally (anger reflecting a violation of boundaries) as well as strengthening emotional intimacy (guilt signals a breach of connection with others). With every emotion, there is a powerful feedback loop to ourselves and others. \n\n*Affective numbing* describes a lack of emotional awareness and expression for many men who experienced abuse as a child. It is a symptom of trauma and manifests as an inability to sense or speak about one's emotions. Affective numbing constrains many men, not only those who have been abused. \n\n*Alexithymia* is similar. Individuals with alexithymia experience emotions but have a hard time naming and expressing them. Instead, when asked about their emotions, they may describe physical symptoms or relay the events of their day instead. A somewhat  related concept is *anhedonia* \u2014 the inability to feel pleasure. While these conditions may not be directly related to a trauma response, they are experiences found most often in men.",

Partners, parents, siblings, even employers have called asking how they can get someone into therapy. The answer is simple: he must want to do the work himself.\n\nSupport has many forms, and these callers show it in their regard. Some offer payment, some offer accompaniment. If they could do the work these men need to do, many would. Yet, all the peace, love and understanding will not make anyone walk the path to healing who is refusing to acknowledge the wounds he is carrying. \n\nWhile he is not responsible for the abuse he experienced, the survivor himself is responsible for his recovery. Repeat that statement as often as you need: It\u2019s not his fault, but it is his problem. Many folks stick to their men out of love that is so big it may be too big. Often, it can be at the loved one\u2019s own expense: their hope collides with reality. People have stayed in relationships that are painful, dysfunctional, and abusive, hoping their man will change. \n\nWhile you can support him in his journey, you can\u2019t make him do it. Time, expense, wasted hope against all hope \u2014 these are the possible costs of this larger-than-life effort to make someone change. Let alone the price you pay when you receive harsh words suggesting you need to mind your own business.\n\nHe is your loved one, not your project. He must want to change his life. You can support him by walking beside him, walking *with* him, providing understanding and support yet not trying to push or pull. Remind yourself to stay in your lane, though. Respecting his boundaries also means respecting *your* boundaries \u2014 the best distance for everyone involved. \n\n## A Note to Therapists and Peer Supporters",

Over time, shame gets internalized in the form of self-loathing, \"loss of self,\" and feelings of insignificance, weakness or unmanliness. This prolonged exposure (known as *shame-hardening*) results in *shame-phobia* \u2014 an avoidance of activities that may result in shame. \n\nHow trauma deepens the shame response will be explored later in this book.

Surface responses don't tell us anything meaningful, nor help you gain insight. Given that men historically haven't been encouraged to be emotionally expressive, superficiality is not that surprising. They are often brought up instead to be the silent ones. \n\nNo doubt there are times when you don't know what you feel or you can't articulate the feeling. When this occurs, take the time you need. Even an experience of emotional \"neutrality\" can be explored. It may feel like waking up from a nap. If it fits, \"calm\" might be a good label for your feelings (or thoughtful, relaxed, content, etc.).\n\nYet, being neutral may also be akin to being cut off from your feelings. In those cases, you could say you are feeling \"numb\" (or emotionless, disoriented, dissociated, etc.). The target is emotional clarity.\n\nThis is in part the purpose of emotional expression \u2014 it brings others closer. There is a certain sweetness when two people can give and receive this invitation to connect.

As shame is the consequence of failing to meet the virtually impossible standards one is supposed to live by, many men experience a type of \"default shame\" because of attempting, and invariably failing, to meet the requirements of *The Big Impossible.* \n\nFrom an early age onwards, most boys are made to feel ashamed by feelings of so-called weakness, vulnerability and fear. Over time, shame gets internalized in the form of self-loathing, \"loss of self,\" and feelings of insignificance, weakness or unmanliness. This prolonged exposure (known as *shame-hardening*) results in *shame-phobia* \u2014 an avoidance of activities that may result in shame. \n\nHow trauma deepens the shame response will be explored later in this book. Fear of shame often cuts men off from those they love and from their genuine selves, leaving them with rigid yet mandated standards to live by.\n\nHow trauma deepens the shame response will be explored later in this book.

The feeling of being cut off \u2014 avoidance, numbing, and patterns of isolation. Life stuck on repeat. Living in the past. Wishing for a better future. A tenuous connection to the here-and-now.\n\nToday may be the day you start to change that. Don't feel bad that you didn't do it yesterday. Perhaps you just weren't ready then. Perhaps now you are. \n\nAt our clinic, the average age of men seeking recovery from childhood trauma is 45 years old. Given that the average age of childhood sexual abuse for boys is between nine and ten years old, men are often waiting decades before they ask for help.

It doesn't help that men, let alone society, don't often seek open discussions on men's mental health. Men, more often than not, just don't want to talk about it. \n\nI want you to consider a term that may be new to you: trauma load. A trauma load refers to your accumulated wounds from childhood, as well as adult experiences of being wounded, including experiences that are known as *revictimization*.\n\nYour trauma load isn't as simple as counting the number of times you were abused. Sometimes, a man who was abused once by someone who be-trayed his trust may experience a heavier trauma load and may have more problems than a man who was repeatedly abused by an acquaintance. \n\nPeople are different. Trauma is tricky.\n\nResearch has shown that many factors can affect the extent of trauma in a man's life:",

Researchers are unsure as to the reasons for this difference \u2014 a matter of brain wiring or socialization or both. Whereas femininity connotes being in relationship with others, masculinity suggests individualism and invulnerability. \n\nMen tend to display less emotional depth in communication, perhaps relying on women to do more of the \"emotional work.\" The advent of boys' puberty marks the beginning of constricted emotional expression between male friends. Overall, males' emotional and social richness tends to atrophy. Their range of emotional granularity (i.e., precise emotional articulation) also diminishes. \n\nBefore proceeding, let's continue to explore why we have emotions in the first place. Emotions serve as an \"early warning system\" \u2014 a way of protecting oneself physically (fear in the face of danger), interpersonally (anger reflecting a violation of boundaries) as well as strengthening emotional intimacy (guilt signals a breach of connection with others). With every emotion, there is a powerful feedback loop to ourselves and others. \n\n*Affective numbing* describes a lack of emotional awareness and expression for many men who experienced abuse as a child. It is a symptom of trauma and manifests as an inability to sense or speak about one's emotions. Affective numbing constrains many men, not only those who have been abused. \n\n*Alexithymia* is similar. Individuals with alexithymia experience emotions but have a hard time naming and expressing them. Instead, when asked about their emotions, they may describe physical symptoms or relay the events of their day instead. A somewhat  related concept is *anhedonia* \u2014 the inability to feel pleasure. While these conditions may not be directly related to a trauma response, they are experiences found most often in men.",

Frankl*\n\nFor someone with unintegrated trauma, every day may seem the same. Days marked by emotional swings, endless replays, things feeling out of control yet needing to be in control. The feeling of being cut off \u2014 avoidance, numbing, and patterns of isolation. Life stuck on repeat. Living in the past. Wishing for a better future. A tenuous connection to the here-and-now.\n\nToday may be the day you start to change that. Don't feel bad that you didn't do it yesterday. Perhaps you just weren't ready then. Perhaps now you are. \n\nAt our clinic, the average age of men seeking recovery from childhood trauma is 45 years old. Given that the average age of childhood sexual abuse for boys is between nine and ten years old, men are often waiting decades before they ask for help. That's a lot of time, much of it in suffering, much of it in silence.\n\n## Breaking Silence",

Researchers are unsure as to the reasons for this difference \u2014 a matter of brain wiring or socialization or both. Whereas femininity connotes being in relationship with others, masculinity suggests individualism and invulnerability. \n\nMen tend to display less emotional depth in communication, perhaps relying on women to do more of the \"emotional work.\" The advent of boys' puberty marks the beginning of constricted emotional expression between male friends. Overall, males' emotional and social richness tends to atrophy. Their range of emotional granularity (i.e., precise emotional articulation) also diminishes. \n\nBefore proceeding, let's continue to explore why we have emotions in the first place. Emotions serve as an \"early warning system\" \u2014 a way of protecting oneself physically (fear in the face of danger), interpersonally (anger reflecting a violation of boundaries) as well as strengthening emotional intimacy (guilt signals a breach of connection with others). With every emotion, there is a powerful feedback loop to ourselves and others. \n\n*Affective numbing* describes a lack of emotional awareness and expression for many men who experienced abuse as a child. It is a symptom of trauma and manifests as an inability to sense or speak about one's emotions. Affective numbing constrains many men, not only those who have been abused. \n\n*Alexithymia* is similar. Individuals with alexithymia experience emotions but have a hard time naming and expressing them. Instead, when asked about their emotions, they may describe physical symptoms or relay the events of their day instead. A somewhat  related concept is *anhedonia* \u2014 the inability to feel pleasure. While these conditions may not be directly related to a trauma response, they are experiences found most often in men.",

          "text": "Now here's the rub. We were all vulnerable as children. All chil-dren are. And the men who were abused were harmed by people, usually people in a position of trust. This is vastly different from being a victim of a hurricane or a car crash. At its core, childhood abuse is an act of betrayal.\n\nIn many respects, it makes \"good sense\" that many survivors are wary of trusting others \u2014 be it a new neighbour, a potential friend, a possible date \u2014 given this history. Fundamentally, if a man concludes that *people = trust = betrayal = suffering*, he will shun connection with anyone who wants to get close to him.\n\nThis is bound to cause problems because people are wired for connection. We are social beings. We are pack animals. For 99% of our time on this planet, we have eked out our existence by living in small bands, organizing ourselves to eat each day and not be eaten. We had to learn skills from each other, adapt to the norms of the group, arrange safety and protection, and get our needs met. This is how we survived as a species. This is who we are and how we are bound together. \n\nWhile someone may \"instinctively\" stay clear of other people as a reaction to betrayal, this isolation prevents healing because it is the very connection with others that is the ticket to recovery.\n\nWe talk about this extensively in our therapy groups. One example comes to mind. For instance, if you read all the self-help books in the world staying in an enclosed room, would you find healing? You would know a lot more, and you could say you were more prepared to take on the work ahead, but you would not experience substantive recovery.\n\nYou *cannot* heal in isolation. You cannot be your \"true self\" in isolation either. Even though you were hurt by other people, the only way to recover is being in relation with others. ",

Often, it must address years, if not decades, of avoidance, let alone curb or replace problematic coping mechanisms. No one can guide themselves to this place of recovery as they have never been there before. Guides are an essential part of the journey.\n\nHere is where a counsellor or therapist comes into play. While they are not the only helping relationship you may employ, their role may be critical for your recovery. They may be essential in your task of acknowledging your truth, hearing your story, and helping you acquire self-compassion. This is quite the responsibility. This level of support may be beyond what a loved one can provide. It often takes a concerned, trained and empathic \"outsider\" to help you chart your way.\n\nIf you are new to the healing process, consider finding a therapist to accompany you on this journey. Apart from learning skills and awareness of what it takes to recover from past abuse, your therapist can inject elements of trust, hope, safety and security. You no longer have to travel alone. \n\nAs the therapeutic relationship deepens over time, you may experience a deep emotional connection. This connection is restorative (a type of repair work), for you to feel unconditional regard, trust and safety \u2014 and will help undo some of the harm of the unsafe relationships you experienced when you were abused.  \n\nWhen you are shopping for a therapist, you may want to consider interviewing prospective helpers to see who can work best with you. You have the right to ask them about their experience, qualifications and approaches to working with the issues. You may also want to consider the following:",

Perhaps now you are. \n\nAt our clinic, the average age of men seeking recovery from childhood trauma is 45 years old.

Experience working with women does not necessarily translate into the same abilities *working with men*. Ask them about their knowledge, comfort and experience working with male clients. Don't overlook this aspect of care. \n\n3. Given the longer-term nature of trauma therapy, you need to determine whether the cost is *affordable*. Some therapists and agencies offer sliding fee scales depending on the client's income. Group therapy is also an option as it is more economical than individual therapy. \n\n4. Having a therapist with whom you feel comfortable, heard and who can challenge you is also key. You may also prefer one gender or another. Its important to find the right *click.*\n\nHere is another angle to consider: group therapy. Being in a group of other folks working on recovery, particularly men, may be helpful. You may learn as much from your \"fellow travellers\" as from the group therapist (often called a *facilitator*). You will meet other people who are dealing with similar problems, share ideas, as well as exchange emotional support. ",

This is vastly different from being a victim of a hurricane or a car crash. At its core, childhood abuse is an act of betrayal.\n\nIn many respects, it makes \"good sense\" that many survivors are wary of trusting others \u2014 be it a new neighbour, a potential friend, a possible date \u2014 given this history. Fundamentally, if a man concludes that *people = trust = betrayal = suffering*, he will shun connection with anyone who wants to get close to him.\n\nThis is bound to cause problems because people are wired for connection. We are social beings. We are pack animals. For 99% of our time on this planet, we have eked out our existence by living in small bands, organizing ourselves to eat each day and not be eaten. We had to learn skills from each other, adapt to the norms of the group, arrange safety and protection, and get our needs met. This is how we survived as a species. This is who we are and how we are bound together. \n\nWhile someone may \"instinctively\" stay clear of other people as a reaction to betrayal, this isolation prevents healing because it is the very connection with others that is the ticket to recovery.\n\nWe talk about this extensively in our therapy groups. One example comes to mind. For instance, if you read all the self-help books in the world staying in an enclosed room, would you find healing? You would know a lot more, and you could say you were more prepared to take on the work ahead, but you would not experience substantive recovery.\n\nYou *cannot* heal in isolation. You cannot be your \"true self\" in isolation either. Even though you were hurt by other people, the only way to recover is being in relation with others. ",

The emphasis here is on the process of *recovery* from trauma. \n\nNot everyone who has experienced childhood abuse ends up being traumatized. Remind yourself that abuse is an inescapable event that often, but not always, overwhelms people's coping mechanisms. And the consequence of abuse can last indefinitely \u2014 years, if not decades, later. Trauma does not necessarily fade with time. \n\nThis book is for the readers who responded affirmatively to the question, \"Were you abused as a child?\" This is a *subjective* approach, which is vastly different from having met the criteria for an *operational* definition of abuse. The same delineation can be made about the term trauma as well. Remember this: abuse was something *done to you* \u2014 it is not part of who you are. A \"traumatic event\" is personal and open to interpretation. And the only expert at the end of the day is you. ",

Survivors of trauma often protect themselves against vulnerability and connection as well. Their personal needs  often have been overridden by other people's needs, which creates confusion, conflict avoidance and/or an unwillingness to allow for vulnerability with others, resulting in a no-win situation for all. \n\nThat said, trouble may follow whenever the individual focuses solely on his own needs (which may be interpreted as aggressive), ignoring his own needs (being passive), or ignoring the needs of both (creating a passive-aggressive dynamic). These patterns could prove harmful to his relationships, including how he generally interacts with everyone \u2014 in sum, his relational self.

          "text": "## The Principle Of Emotional Integrity\n\nWhile emotional expression is important, it needs to be taken one step further. We call this deepening of relationships *Emotional Integrity (EI)*. While there are many definitions of the notion of integrity, EI focuses on matters of the heart \u2014 how we carry ourselves with \"significant \"(or important) people in our life.\n\nA simple way of understanding EI is this: matching our thoughts with our feelings and behaviours. The notion is to ensure that one \"walks the talk.\" While this is helpful, it doesn't tell us how to get there. For that, we need to dig into EI in a deeper, more profound way.\n\nThink of EI as putting emotional intelligence into action. It requires a three-step process, and for it to pay off, it must proceed in the order outlined: \n\n**Step #1: Be honest with yourself.** Easy to say, but not to do. Profound honesty. Keep in mind that many people wear blinders as to who they are, oblivious to their inner process, or how they come across to others. Radical self-acceptance is needed, much like seeing your entire image in a mirror and not turning away. As no one can judge if you are doing this yourself, you must be the final arbitrator of honesty. Fundamentally though, you cannot make any changes in your life (think trauma recovery) without succeeding in this first and primary step. Nothing in life can be achieved by shielding one's eyes.\n\n**Step #2:** Take responsibility for your feelings and behaviours. Again, easy to say, yet difficult to do. Even if you don't know what you are feeling, you have to own your behaviours and not blame them on your past, other people, etc. No longer can you say, \"she pushed my buttons\" or \"I just flipped out\" \u2014 nothing but full responsibility must be taken.

A tenuous connection to the here-and-now.\n\nToday may be the day you start to change that. Don't feel bad that you didn't do it yesterday. Perhaps you just weren't ready then. Perhaps now you are. \n\nAt our clinic, the average age of men seeking recovery from childhood trauma is 45 years old. Given that the average age of childhood sexual abuse for boys is between nine and ten years old, men are often waiting decades before they ask for help. That's a lot of time, much of it in suffering, much of it in silence.\n\n## Breaking Silence",

Chapter 3 will explore this connection between masculinity and emotional constriction further \u2014 the throttling of one's emotional expression due to gender coding. \n\nIn our group work, men are reminded that emotional reflection is what counts, rather than sharing their thoughts or responding in a superficial manner. Surface responses don't tell us anything meaningful, nor help you gain insight. Given that men historically haven't been encouraged to be emotionally expressive, superficiality is not that surprising. They are often brought up instead to be the silent ones. \n\nNo doubt there are times when you don't know what you feel or you can't articulate the feeling. When this occurs, take the time you need. Even an experience of emotional \"neutrality\" can be explored. It may feel like waking up from a nap. If it fits, \"calm\" might be a good label for your feelings (or thoughtful, relaxed, content, etc.).\n\nYet, being neutral may also be akin to being cut off from your feelings. In those cases, you could say you are feeling \"numb\" (or emotionless, disoriented, dissociated, etc.). The target is emotional clarity.\n\nThis is in part the purpose of emotional expression \u2014 it brings others closer. There is a certain sweetness when two people can give and receive this invitation to connect. In doing so, you can allow yourself to enter this \"truer\" aspect of relationship \u2014 and get some accompaniment on your journey as well. \n\n## The Principle Of Asking For What You Want",

          "text": "## Emotional Compression\n\nStudies have shown that women have greater emotional awareness and a larger emotional lexicon than men. Researchers are unsure as to the reasons for this difference \u2014 a matter of brain wiring or socialization or both. Whereas femininity connotes being in relationship with others, masculinity suggests individualism and invulnerability. \n\nMen tend to display less emotional depth in communication, perhaps relying on women to do more of the \"emotional work.\" The advent of boys' puberty marks the beginning of constricted emotional expression between male friends. Overall, males' emotional and social richness tends to atrophy. Their range of emotional granularity (i.e., precise emotional articulation) also diminishes. \n\nBefore proceeding, let's continue to explore why we have emotions in the first place. Emotions serve as an \"early warning system\" \u2014 a way of protecting oneself physically (fear in the face of danger), interpersonally (anger reflecting a violation of boundaries) as well as strengthening emotional intimacy (guilt signals a breach of connection with others). With every emotion, there is a powerful feedback loop to ourselves and others. \n\n*Affective numbing* describes a lack of emotional awareness and expression for many men who experienced abuse as a child. It is a symptom of trauma and manifests as an inability to sense or speak about one's emotions. Affective numbing constrains many men, not only those who have been abused. \n\n*Alexithymia* is similar. Individuals with alexithymia experience emotions but have a hard time naming and expressing them. Instead, when asked about their emotions, they may describe physical symptoms or relay the events of their day instead. A somewhat  related concept is *anhedonia* \u2014 the inability to feel pleasure. While these conditions may not be directly related to a trauma response, they are experiences found most often in men.",

These wounds are considered developmental trauma, as they interfere with the child\u2019s psychosocial development and they may persist into adulthood. \n\nThere is no need to list all the examples of various types of childhood abuse as no one finds themselves in lists (there are many sources for types of victimization, if that is a particular learning need).

It is estimated that about *one in six males* experience \u201ccontact\u201d sexual abuse by age 18. This figure is an average of many North American research studies. Contact sexual abuse means abuse that involves touch between the victim and the person(s) who offended them. Children and youth can also experience sexual abuse that does not involve touch, such as exposure to pornography or a parent purposely disrobing themselves for sexual arousal. If these other noncontact forms of sexual abuse were included in this research, higher overall rates would be found. ",

Often, it must address years, if not decades, of avoidance, let alone curb or replace problematic coping mechanisms. No one can guide themselves to this place of recovery as they have never been there before. Guides are an essential part of the journey.\n\nHere is where a counsellor or therapist comes into play. While they are not the only helping relationship you may employ, their role may be critical for your recovery. They may be essential in your task of acknowledging your truth, hearing your story, and helping you acquire self-compassion. This is quite the responsibility. This level of support may be beyond what a loved one can provide. It often takes a concerned, trained and empathic \"outsider\" to help you chart your way.\n\nIf you are new to the healing process, consider finding a therapist to accompany you on this journey. Apart from learning skills and awareness of what it takes to recover from past abuse, your therapist can inject elements of trust, hope, safety and security. You no longer have to travel alone. \n\nAs the therapeutic relationship deepens over time, you may experience a deep emotional connection. This connection is restorative (a type of repair work), for you to feel unconditional regard, trust and safety \u2014 and will help undo some of the harm of the unsafe relationships you experienced when you were abused.  \n\nWhen you are shopping for a therapist, you may want to consider interviewing prospective helpers to see who can work best with you.

This is vastly different from being a victim of a hurricane or a car crash. At its core, childhood abuse is an act of betrayal.\n\nIn many respects, it makes \"good sense\" that many survivors are wary of trusting others \u2014 be it a new neighbour, a potential friend, a possible date \u2014 given this history. Fundamentally, if a man concludes that *people = trust = betrayal = suffering*, he will shun connection with anyone who wants to get close to him.\n\nThis is bound to cause problems because people are wired for connection. We are social beings. We are pack animals. For 99% of our time on this planet, we have eked out our existence by living in small bands, organizing ourselves to eat each day and not be eaten. We had to learn skills from each other, adapt to the norms of the group, arrange safety and protection, and get our needs met. This is how we survived as a species. This is who we are and how we are bound together. \n\nWhile someone may \"instinctively\" stay clear of other people as a reaction to betrayal, this isolation prevents healing because it is the very connection with others that is the ticket to recovery.\n\nWe talk about this extensively in our therapy groups. One example comes to mind. For instance, if you read all the self-help books in the world staying in an enclosed room, would you find healing? You would know a lot more, and you could say you were more prepared to take on the work ahead, but you would not experience substantive recovery.\n\nYou *cannot* heal in isolation. You cannot be your \"true self\" in isolation either. Even though you were hurt by other people, the only way to recover is being in relation with others. ",

This section will provide some practical tips on how to communicate with greater awareness, ability and integrity \u2014 something men and trauma survivors often have trouble doing.  \n\nMany men have ingrained patterns of communication in which their real needs are often unmet in relationships. In part, this is due to stoicism and self-sacrifice \u2014 endemic traits in modern masculinity (themes that will be explored in the next chapter). Survivors of trauma often protect themselves against vulnerability and connection as well. Their personal needs  often have been overridden by other people's needs, which creates confusion, conflict avoidance and/or an unwillingness to allow for vulnerability with others, resulting in a no-win situation for all. \n\nThat said, trouble may follow whenever the individual focuses solely on his own needs (which may be interpreted as aggressive), ignoring his own needs (being passive), or ignoring the needs of both (creating a passive-aggressive dynamic). These patterns could prove harmful to his relationships, including how he generally interacts with everyone \u2014 in sum, his relational self. Many men need to be reminded about the strength and clarity of assertiveness, whereby both one's own needs and the other person's needs can be respected. \n\nThe principle of assertiveness can help you to stand up for your rights and needs while respecting the rights and needs of others.

          "text": "## The Principle Of Emotional Integrity\n\nWhile emotional expression is important, it needs to be taken one step further. We call this deepening of relationships *Emotional Integrity (EI)*. While there are many definitions of the notion of integrity, EI focuses on matters of the heart \u2014 how we carry ourselves with \"significant \"(or important) people in our life.\n\nA simple way of understanding EI is this: matching our thoughts with our feelings and behaviours. The notion is to ensure that one \"walks the talk.\" While this is helpful, it doesn't tell us how to get there. For that, we need to dig into EI in a deeper, more profound way.\n\nThink of EI as putting emotional intelligence into action. It requires a three-step process, and for it to pay off, it must proceed in the order outlined: \n\n**Step #1: Be honest with yourself.** Easy to say, but not to do. Profound honesty. Keep in mind that many people wear blinders as to who they are, oblivious to their inner process, or how they come across to others. Radical self-acceptance is needed, much like seeing your entire image in a mirror and not turning away. As no one can judge if you are doing this yourself, you must be the final arbitrator of honesty. Fundamentally though, you cannot make any changes in your life (think trauma recovery) without succeeding in this first and primary step. Nothing in life can be achieved by shielding one's eyes.\n\n**Step #2:** Take responsibility for your feelings and behaviours. Again, easy to say, yet difficult to do. Even if you don't know what you are feeling, you have to own your behaviours and not blame them on your past, other people, etc. No longer can you say, \"she pushed my buttons\" or \"I just flipped out\" \u2014 nothing but full responsibility must be taken.

Chapter 3 will explore this connection between masculinity and emotional constriction further \u2014 the throttling of one's emotional expression due to gender coding. \n\nIn our group work, men are reminded that emotional reflection is what counts, rather than sharing their thoughts or responding in a superficial manner. Surface responses don't tell us anything meaningful, nor help you gain insight. Given that men historically haven't been encouraged to be emotionally expressive, superficiality is not that surprising. They are often brought up instead to be the silent ones. \n\nNo doubt there are times when you don't know what you feel or you can't articulate the feeling. When this occurs, take the time you need. Even an experience of emotional \"neutrality\" can be explored. It may feel like waking up from a nap. If it fits, \"calm\" might be a good label for your feelings (or thoughtful, relaxed, content, etc.).\n\nYet, being neutral may also be akin to being cut off from your feelings. In those cases, you could say you are feeling \"numb\" (or emotionless, disoriented, dissociated, etc.). The target is emotional clarity.\n\nThis is in part the purpose of emotional expression \u2014 it brings others closer. There is a certain sweetness when two people can give and receive this invitation to connect. In doing so, you can allow yourself to enter this \"truer\" aspect of relationship \u2014 and get some accompaniment on your journey as well. \n\n## The Principle Of Asking For What You Want",

And while assertiveness doesn't guarantee you will get the outcome you want, it's the best bet for success.\n\n## The Principle Of \"Fighting Fairly\"\n\nEven in relationships that value the notion of responsible assertiveness, disagreement and conflicts will still occur. With past abuse, many men tend to avoid conflict as it may spark memories of past pain. Other men may rely on conflict to get what they want. Given the need to hold yourself respectfully in situations of conflict, you may need to remind yourself that you can proceed in ways that are respectful to yourself, to other(s) and to the relationship as a whole.

Almost all groups have guidelines around conduct. It is the therapist's job (not the group members) to ensure the group maintains safety and trust for all. \n\nGroup work provides connection with others. In many ways, it is like a laboratory to try out new awarenesses, share experiences that may be unvoiced, practise new skills of expression, vulnerability and allow for normalizing \u2014 no longer seeing oneself as the only one who went through a particular experience. By con-tributing their stories, participants will view their experiences differently.\n\nGroup therapy has been referred to as \"Triple E\" treatment: it is *equivalent* to the experience of individual therapy; it is seen as clinically *effective*, and lastly it is more *economical* than individual work.\n\nThe ideal arrangement is to consider both individual and group work concurrently as it will allow you to heal in different ways. Think of therapy as being analogous to the needs of trees. Tree roots require *depth* for sustenance \u2014 they need to go deep. This is the role of individual therapy.

Researchers are unsure as to the reasons for this difference \u2014 a matter of brain wiring or socialization or both. Whereas femininity connotes being in relationship with others, masculinity suggests individualism and invulnerability. \n\nMen tend to display less emotional depth in communication, perhaps relying on women to do more of the \"emotional work.\" The advent of boys' puberty marks the beginning of constricted emotional expression between male friends. Overall, males' emotional and social richness tends to atrophy. Their range of emotional granularity (i.e., precise emotional articulation) also diminishes. \n\nBefore proceeding, let's continue to explore why we have emotions in the first place. Emotions serve as an \"early warning system\" \u2014 a way of protecting oneself physically (fear in the face of danger), interpersonally (anger reflecting a violation of boundaries) as well as strengthening emotional intimacy (guilt signals a breach of connection with others). With every emotion, there is a powerful feedback loop to ourselves and others. \n\n*Affective numbing* describes a lack of emotional awareness and expression for many men who experienced abuse as a child. It is a symptom of trauma and manifests as an inability to sense or speak about one's emotions. Affective numbing constrains many men, not only those who have been abused. \n\n*Alexithymia* is similar. Individuals with alexithymia experience emotions but have a hard time naming and expressing them. Instead, when asked about their emotions, they may describe physical symptoms or relay the events of their day instead. A somewhat  related concept is *anhedonia* \u2014 the inability to feel pleasure.

Self-compassion is a way of accepting yourself with kindness and concern.

While later chapters will explore how to rebuild compassion for oneself, for now it just needs to be recognized.\n\n1. *Self-kindness (vs. self-judgement):* Being warm and understanding towards yourself with regard to suffering and pain.\n2. *A sense of shared humanity (vs. isolation):* Recognizing that suffering and personal inadequacy is part of the human experience.\n3. *Balance (vs. over-identification):* Accepting all emotions, while avoiding suppressing or exaggerating them.",

Often, it must address years, if not decades, of avoidance, let alone curb or replace problematic coping mechanisms. No one can guide themselves to this place of recovery as they have never been there before. Guides are an essential part of the journey.\n\nHere is where a counsellor or therapist comes into play. While they are not the only helping relationship you may employ, their role may be critical for your recovery. They may be essential in your task of acknowledging your truth, hearing your story, and helping you acquire self-compassion. This is quite the responsibility. This level of support may be beyond what a loved one can provide. It often takes a concerned, trained and empathic \"outsider\" to help you chart your way.\n\nIf you are new to the healing process, consider finding a therapist to accompany you on this journey. Apart from learning skills and awareness of what it takes to recover from past abuse, your therapist can inject elements of trust, hope, safety and security. You no longer have to travel alone. \n\nAs the therapeutic relationship deepens over time, you may experience a deep emotional connection. This connection is restorative (a type of repair work), for you to feel unconditional regard, trust and safety \u2014 and will help undo some of the harm of the unsafe relationships you experienced when you were abused.  \n\nWhen you are shopping for a therapist, you may want to consider interviewing prospective helpers to see who can work best with you. You have the right to ask them about their experience, qualifications and approaches to working with the issues. You may also want to consider the following:",

Twice a meeting, men in our trauma recovery groups practise deepening their emotional expression:\n\n*\"Let's hear from everyone in our opening (closing) round and 'check-in.' In a few words, tell us how you are feeling right now, at this very moment (e.g. glad, sad, mad, anxious, calm, etc.). Feelings more than thoughts.\"*\n\nThis instruction rails against the ingrained principle of responding to \"How are you?\" with a facile, socially accepted reply like, \"I'm good.\" Yet, it is on this deeper, more profound level that we must start building emotional literacy.

Survivors of trauma often protect themselves against vulnerability and connection as well. Their personal needs  often have been overridden by other people's needs, which creates confusion, conflict avoidance and/or an unwillingness to allow for vulnerability with others, resulting in a no-win situation for all. \n\nThat said, trouble may follow whenever the individual focuses solely on his own needs (which may be interpreted as aggressive), ignoring his own needs (being passive), or ignoring the needs of both (creating a passive-aggressive dynamic). These patterns could prove harmful to his relationships, including how he generally interacts with everyone \u2014 in sum, his relational self. Many men need to be reminded about the strength and clarity of assertiveness, whereby both one's own needs and the other person's needs can be respected. \n\nThe principle of assertiveness can help you to stand up for your rights and needs while respecting the rights and needs of others.

Experience working with women does not necessarily translate into the same abilities *working with men*. Ask them about their knowledge, comfort and experience working with male clients. Don't overlook this aspect of care. \n\n3. Given the longer-term nature of trauma therapy, you need to determine whether the cost is *affordable*. Some therapists and agencies offer sliding fee scales depending on the client's income. Group therapy is also an option as it is more economical than individual therapy. \n\n4. Having a therapist with whom you feel comfortable, heard and who can challenge you is also key. You may also prefer one gender or another. Its important to find the right *click.*\n\nHere is another angle to consider: group therapy. Being in a group of other folks working on recovery, particularly men, may be helpful. You may learn as much from your \"fellow travellers\" as from the group therapist (often called a *facilitator*).

          "text": "## Finding Allies On Your Journey\n\nBy now you understand that trauma recovery is no picnic. Instead, it's long haul work, fraught with complexities. Often, it must address years, if not decades, of avoidance, let alone curb or replace problematic coping mechanisms. No one can guide themselves to this place of recovery as they have never been there before. Guides are an essential part of the journey.\n\nHere is where a counsellor or therapist comes into play. While they are not the only helping relationship you may employ, their role may be critical for your recovery. They may be essential in your task of acknowledging your truth, hearing your story, and helping you acquire self-compassion. This is quite the responsibility. This level of support may be beyond what a loved one can provide. It often takes a concerned, trained and empathic \"outsider\" to help you chart your way.\n\nIf you are new to the healing process, consider finding a therapist to accompany you on this journey. Apart from learning skills and awareness of what it takes to recover from past abuse, your therapist can inject elements of trust, hope, safety and security. You no longer have to travel alone. \n\nAs the therapeutic relationship deepens over time, you may experience a deep emotional connection. This connection is restorative (a type of repair work), for you to feel unconditional regard, trust and safety \u2014 and will help undo some of the harm of the unsafe relationships you experienced when you were abused.  \n\nWhen you are shopping for a therapist, you may want to consider interviewing prospective helpers to see who can work best with you. You have the right to ask them about their experience, qualifications and approaches to working with the issues. You may also want to consider the following:",

Researchers are unsure as to the reasons for this difference \u2014 a matter of brain wiring or socialization or both. Whereas femininity connotes being in relationship with others, masculinity suggests individualism and invulnerability. \n\nMen tend to display less emotional depth in communication, perhaps relying on women to do more of the \"emotional work.\" The advent of boys' puberty marks the beginning of constricted emotional expression between male friends. Overall, males' emotional and social richness tends to atrophy. Their range of emotional granularity (i.e., precise emotional articulation) also diminishes. \n\nBefore proceeding, let's continue to explore why we have emotions in the first place. Emotions serve as an \"early warning system\" \u2014 a way of protecting oneself physically (fear in the face of danger), interpersonally (anger reflecting a violation of boundaries) as well as strengthening emotional intimacy (guilt signals a breach of connection with others). With every emotion, there is a powerful feedback loop to ourselves and others. \n\n*Affective numbing* describes a lack of emotional awareness and expression for many men who experienced abuse as a child. It is a symptom of trauma and manifests as an inability to sense or speak about one's emotions. Affective numbing constrains many men, not only those who have been abused. \n\n*Alexithymia* is similar. Individuals with alexithymia experience emotions but have a hard time naming and expressing them. Instead, when asked about their emotions, they may describe physical symptoms or relay the events of their day instead. A somewhat  related concept is *anhedonia* \u2014 the inability to feel pleasure. While these conditions may not be directly related to a trauma response, they are experiences found most often in men.",

Contact sexual abuse means abuse that involves touch between the victim and the person(s) who offended them. Children and youth can also experience sexual abuse that does not involve touch, such as exposure to pornography or a parent purposely disrobing themselves for sexual arousal.

Trauma may be a new word to consider, or it may be as familiar to you as a dirty shirt. No matter. Trauma is the present-day injury from the abuse of the past. The emphasis here is on the process of *recovery* from trauma. \n\nNot everyone who has experienced childhood abuse ends up being traumatized. Remind yourself that abuse is an inescapable event that often, but not always, overwhelms people's coping mechanisms. And the consequence of abuse can last indefinitely \u2014 years, if not decades, later. Trauma does not necessarily fade with time. \n\nThis book is for the readers who responded affirmatively to the question, \"Were you abused as a child?\" This is a *subjective* approach, which is vastly different from having met the criteria for an *operational* definition of abuse. The same delineation can be made about the term trauma as well. Remember this: abuse was something *done to you* \u2014 it is not part of who you are. A \"traumatic event\" is personal and open to interpretation. And the only expert at the end of the day is you. ",

This is vastly different from being a victim of a hurricane or a car crash. At its core, childhood abuse is an act of betrayal.\n\nIn many respects, it makes \"good sense\" that many survivors are wary of trusting others \u2014 be it a new neighbour, a potential friend, a possible date \u2014 given this history. Fundamentally, if a man concludes that *people = trust = betrayal = suffering*, he will shun connection with anyone who wants to get close to him.\n\nThis is bound to cause problems because people are wired for connection. We are social beings. We are pack animals. For 99% of our time on this planet, we have eked out our existence by living in small bands, organizing ourselves to eat each day and not be eaten. We had to learn skills from each other, adapt to the norms of the group, arrange safety and protection, and get our needs met. This is how we survived as a species. This is who we are and how we are bound together. \n\nWhile someone may \"instinctively\" stay clear of other people as a reaction to betrayal, this isolation prevents healing because it is the very connection with others that is the ticket to recovery.\n\nWe talk about this extensively in our therapy groups. One example comes to mind. For instance, if you read all the self-help books in the world staying in an enclosed room, would you find healing? You would know a lot more, and you could say you were more prepared to take on the work ahead, but you would not experience substantive recovery.\n\nYou *cannot* heal in isolation. You cannot be your \"true self\" in isolation either. Even though you were hurt by other people, the only way to recover is being in relation with others. ",

What were the messages you told yourself about the abuse? \n3. What kept you silent about the abuse? You may wish to reflect on how old you were when you disclosed the abuse. What did you do to break this silence? Who did you tell? What were the qualities of this connection that allowed you to disclose eventually? If you haven't told anyone about the abuse, what might be holding you back from doing so?\n\n## Fellow Traveller Quotes\n\n*I never could talk about it in the past. Instead, I would keep it a secret, or tear up when I saw an intervention on a TV show. Now I know I wasn't facing my past. Now that I can talk about it more comfortably, I believe healing is happening now.*\n\n*always seem to say things like \"what happened to me\" or \"the stuff I went through.\" I have a really hard time with the terminology. Back then he called it \"playing around.\" That's why it seemed, on some level, acceptable.*",

Try to envision a picture of your destination and what it would feel like to arrive. Your imagination, along with knowledge, will get you to the finish line. Imagination allows for possibilities \u2014 it is the call of the daring. Let it become your North Star.\n\n## About Childhood Wounds\n\nThis book focuses on the *response to trauma* \u2014 the overwhelming experience that past events have had on your life. Trauma may be a new word to consider, or it may be as familiar to you as a dirty shirt. No matter. Trauma is the present-day injury from the abuse of the past. The emphasis here is on the process of recovery from trauma. \n\nNot everyone who has experienced childhood abuse ends up being traumatized. Remind yourself that abuse is an inescapable event that often, but not always, overwhelms people\u2019s coping mechanisms. And the consequence of abuse can last indefinitely \u2014 years, if not decades, later. Trauma does not necessarily fade with time. \n\nThis book is for the readers who responded affirmatively to the question, \u201cWere you abused as a child?\u201d This is a *subjective* approach, which is vastly different from having met the criteria for an *operational* definition of abuse. The same delineation can be made about the term trauma as well. Remember this: abuse was something *done to you* \u2014 it is not part of who you are. A \u201ctraumatic event\u201d is personal and open to interpretation. And the only expert at the end of the day is you. ",

Once you choose who can hold space for your story, you are no longer alone on your journey to recovery. \n\nYou may note a friction in the work ahead: silence and isolation have been essential to managing your pain, but articulating your experience and finding social bonds are now going to prove essential on your path to recovery. This is one of the many paradoxes required for trauma recovery. We will explore that in a bit.\n\n## Emotional Literacy\n\nAll skills require practice. Men in therapy are no exception. Twice a meeting, men in our trauma recovery groups practise deepening their emotional expression:\n\n*\"Let's hear from everyone in our opening (closing) round and 'check-in.' In a few words, tell us how you are feeling right now, at this very moment (e.g. glad, sad, mad, anxious, calm, etc.). Feelings more than thoughts.\"*\n\nThis instruction rails against the ingrained principle of responding to \"How are you?\" with a facile, socially accepted reply like, \"I'm good.\" Yet, it is on this deeper, more profound level that we must start building emotional literacy. The work of expressing emotional vulnerability is essential \u2014 a form of truth-telling you can start practising in your day-to-day life. ",

These questions may help guide you in journaling about your experiences, and in your learning and reflection. Each chapter also contains quotes taken from a variety of sources, including statements from men who have been on this journey ahead of you. You will also find occasional QR codes throughout the book that link to short videos we produced with our American agency partner *1in6, Inc.* Lastly, at the end of the book, you will find references for each chapter and recommendations for further reading. \n\n*My feelings are still so confused about that time in my life. Once it led to a police investigation, and one of the detectives said to me, \"You were a victim of sexual assault.\" That statement rocked my world. - Fellow Traveller*\n\n## A Note About Language\n\nAs this book is aimed at *male-identified individuals*, I will make frequent use of the terms boys, male youth and men. Of course, there is a myriad of gender and sexual identities, and the intent is not to limit or exclude any individual who has experienced woundedness from childhood. As gender plays a core role in who we all are, it impacts not only the immediate experience of the abuse but how such injuries are later expressed. One\u2019s gender identity is also critical in how to chart the healing journey. All that said, if this book can speak to you, let it. \n\nMen\u2019s \u201csignificant others\u201d, wives, husbands, lovers, are all referenced in the book by the singular term of \u201cpartner\u201d. Of course, a man may have more than one such person in their life, and no slight is intended. \n\nAs a male-identified person myself, I will occasionally include myself in the notion of \u201cwe as men\u201d, referring to a shared connection, a men\u2019s circle, the male condition. Also, I want to share that I am a survivor of childhood sexual abuse as well. However, this book is not about me, and I won\u2019t be sharing my own story of wounding and recovery. ",

You can be his witness.\n\n## The Abuse Of Boys\n\nNo one knows how many males are *sexually* abused as children. It is estimated that about *one in six males* experiences \"contact\" sexual abuse by age 18. This figure is an average of many North American research studies. Contact sexual abuse means abuse that involves touch between the victim and the person(s) who offended them. Children and youth can also experience sexual abuse that does not involve touch, such as exposure to pornography or a parent purposely disrobing for sexual arousal. If these other noncontact forms of sexual abuse were included in this research, higher overall rates would be found. \n\nSpecific populations of males are known to have higher rates of sexual abuse. Research suggests that Indigenous men, Queer men (i.e., gay and bisexual men and trans folks), men who have been incarcerated, and men with disabilities are known to experience higher rates of childhood abuse. There is still much to learn about who is impacted by this issue and to what degree. ",

As no one knows how many men have been harmed as children, let alone how to define it, it will be up to you to decide about your own life. \n\n## Trauma Loads and More\n\nMany male survivors want to understand why they feel the way they do and how this compares to the experiences of other men. It doesn\u2019t help that men, let alone society, don\u2019t often seek open discussions on men\u2019s mental health. Men, more often than not, just don\u2019t want to talk about it. \n\nI want you to consider a term that may be new to you: trauma load. A trauma load refers to your accumulated wounds from childhood, as well as adult experiences of being wounded, including experiences that are known as *revictimization*. \n\nYour trauma load isn\u2019t as simple as counting the number of times you were abused. Sometimes, a man who was abused once by someone who be-trayed his trust may experience a heavier trauma load and may have more problems than a man who was repeatedly abused by an acquaintance. \n\nPeople are different.

As shame is the consequence of failing to meet the virtually impossible standards one is supposed to live by, many men experience a type of \"default shame\" because of attempting, and invariably failing, to meet the requirements of *The Big Impossible.* \n\nFrom an early age onwards, most boys are made to feel ashamed by feelings of so-called weakness, vulnerability and fear. Over time, shame gets internalized in the form of self-loathing, \"loss of self,\" and feelings of insignificance, weakness or unmanliness. This prolonged exposure (known as *shame-hardening*) results in *shame-phobia* \u2014 an avoidance of activities that may result in shame. \n\nHow trauma deepens the shame response will be explored later in this book. Fear of shame often cuts men off from those they love and from their genuine selves, leaving them with rigid yet mandated standards to live by.\n\nHow trauma deepens the shame response will be explored later in this book.

Researchers are unsure as to the reasons for this difference \u2014 a matter of brain wiring or socialization or both. Whereas femininity connotes being in relationship with others, masculinity suggests individualism and invulnerability. \n\nMen tend to display less emotional depth in communication, perhaps relying on women to do more of the \"emotional work.\" The advent of boys' puberty marks the beginning of constricted emotional expression between male friends. Overall, males' emotional and social richness tends to atrophy. Their range of emotional granularity (i.e., precise emotional articulation) also diminishes. \n\nBefore proceeding, let's continue to explore why we have emotions in the first place. Emotions serve as an \"early warning system\" \u2014 a way of protecting oneself physically (fear in the face of danger), interpersonally (anger reflecting a violation of boundaries) as well as strengthening emotional intimacy (guilt signals a breach of connection with others). With every emotion, there is a powerful feedback loop to ourselves and others. \n\n*Affective numbing* describes a lack of emotional awareness and expression for many men who experienced abuse as a child. It is a symptom of trauma and manifests as an inability to sense or speak about one's emotions. Affective numbing constrains many men, not only those who have been abused. \n\n*Alexithymia* is similar. Individuals with alexithymia experience emotions but have a hard time naming and expressing them. Instead, when asked about their emotions, they may describe physical symptoms or relay the events of their day instead. A somewhat  related concept is *anhedonia* \u2014 the inability to feel pleasure. While these conditions may not be directly related to a trauma response, they are experiences found most often in men.",

          "text": "Now here's the rub. We were all vulnerable as children. All chil-dren are. And the men who were abused were harmed by people, usually people in a position of trust. This is vastly different from being a victim of a hurricane or a car crash. At its core, childhood abuse is an act of betrayal.\n\nIn many respects, it makes \"good sense\" that many survivors are wary of trusting others \u2014 be it a new neighbour, a potential friend, a possible date \u2014 given this history. Fundamentally, if a man concludes that *people = trust = betrayal = suffering*, he will shun connection with anyone who wants to get close to him.\n\nThis is bound to cause problems because people are wired for connection. We are social beings. We are pack animals. For 99% of our time on this planet, we have eked out our existence by living in small bands, organizing ourselves to eat each day and not be eaten. We had to learn skills from each other, adapt to the norms of the group, arrange safety and protection, and get our needs met. This is how we survived as a species. This is who we are and how we are bound together. \n\nWhile someone may \"instinctively\" stay clear of other people as a reaction to betrayal, this isolation prevents healing because it is the very connection with others that is the ticket to recovery.\n\nWe talk about this extensively in our therapy groups. One example comes to mind. For instance, if you read all the self-help books in the world staying in an enclosed room, would you find healing? You would know a lot more, and you could say you were more prepared to take on the work ahead, but you would not experience substantive recovery.\n\nYou *cannot* heal in isolation. You cannot be your \"true self\" in isolation either. Even though you were hurt by other people, the only way to recover is being in relation with others. ",

Twice a meeting, men in our trauma recovery groups practise deepening their emotional expression:\n\n*\"Let's hear from everyone in our opening (closing) round and 'check-in.' In a few words, tell us how you are feeling right now, at this very moment (e.g. glad, sad, mad, anxious, calm, etc.). Feelings more than thoughts.\"*\n\nThis instruction rails against the ingrained principle of responding to \"How are you?\" with a facile, socially accepted reply like, \"I'm good.\" Yet, it is on this deeper, more profound level that we must start building emotional literacy.

Often, it must address years, if not decades, of avoidance, let alone curb or replace problematic coping mechanisms. No one can guide themselves to this place of recovery as they have never been there before. Guides are an essential part of the journey.\n\nHere is where a counsellor or therapist comes into play. While they are not the only helping relationship you may employ, their role may be critical for your recovery. They may be essential in your task of acknowledging your truth, hearing your story, and helping you acquire self-compassion. This is quite the responsibility. This level of support may be beyond what a loved one can provide. It often takes a concerned, trained and empathic \"outsider\" to help you chart your way.\n\nIf you are new to the healing process, consider finding a therapist to accompany you on this journey. Apart from learning skills and awareness of what it takes to recover from past abuse, your therapist can inject elements of trust, hope, safety and security. You no longer have to travel alone. \n\nAs the therapeutic relationship deepens over time, you may experience a deep emotional connection. This connection is restorative (a type of repair work), for you to feel unconditional regard, trust and safety \u2014 and will help undo some of the harm of the unsafe relationships you experienced when you were abused.  \n\nWhen you are shopping for a therapist, you may want to consider interviewing prospective helpers to see who can work best with you.

Once it led to a police investigation, and one of the detectives said to me, \"You were a victim of sexual assault.\" That statement rocked my world. - Fellow Traveller*\n\n## A Note About Language\n\nAs this book is aimed at *male-identified individuals*, I will make frequent use of the terms boys, male youth and men. Of course, there is a myriad of gender and sexual identities, and the intent is not to limit or exclude any individual who has experienced woundedness from childhood. As gender plays a core role in who we all are, it impacts not only the immediate experience of the abuse but how such injuries are later expressed. One\u2019s gender identity is also critical in how to chart the healing journey. All that said, if this book can speak to you, let it. \n\nMen\u2019s \u201csignificant others\u201d, wives, husbands, lovers, are all referenced in the book by the singular term of \u201cpartner\u201d. Of course, a man may have more than one such person in their life, and no slight is intended. \n\nAs a male-identified person myself, I will occasionally include myself in the notion of \u201cwe as men\u201d, referring to a shared connection, a men\u2019s circle, the male condition. Also, I want to share that I am a survivor of childhood sexual abuse as well. However, this book is not about me, and I won\u2019t be sharing my own story of wounding and recovery. ",

Once you choose who can hold space for your story, you are no longer alone on your journey to recovery. \n\nYou may note a friction in the work ahead: silence and isolation have been essential to managing your pain, but articulating your experience and finding social bonds are now going to prove essential on your path to recovery. This is one of the many paradoxes required for trauma recovery. We will explore that in a bit.\n\n## Emotional Literacy\n\nAll skills require practice. Men in therapy are no exception. Twice a meeting, men in our trauma recovery groups practise deepening their emotional expression:\n\n*\"Let's hear from everyone in our opening (closing) round and 'check-in.' In a few words, tell us how you are feeling right now, at this very moment (e.g. glad, sad, mad, anxious, calm, etc.). Feelings more than thoughts.\"*\n\nThis instruction rails against the ingrained principle of responding to \"How are you?\" with a facile, socially accepted reply like, \"I'm good.\" Yet, it is on this deeper, more profound level that we must start building emotional literacy. The work of expressing emotional vulnerability is essential \u2014 a form of truth-telling you can start practising in your day-to-day life. ",

It is not a linear process that can be intellectualized.

          "text": "Now here's the rub. We were all vulnerable as children. All chil-dren are. And the men who were abused were harmed by people, usually people in a position of trust. This is vastly different from being a victim of a hurricane or a car crash. At its core, childhood abuse is an act of betrayal.\n\nIn many respects, it makes \"good sense\" that many survivors are wary of trusting others \u2014 be it a new neighbour, a potential friend, a possible date \u2014 given this history. Fundamentally, if a man concludes that *people = trust = betrayal = suffering*, he will shun connection with anyone who wants to get close to him.\n\nThis is bound to cause problems because people are wired for connection. We are social beings. We are pack animals. For 99% of our time on this planet, we have eked out our existence by living in small bands, organizing ourselves to eat each day and not be eaten. We had to learn skills from each other, adapt to the norms of the group, arrange safety and protection, and get our needs met. This is how we survived as a species. This is who we are and how we are bound together. \n\nWhile someone may \"instinctively\" stay clear of other people as a reaction to betrayal, this isolation prevents healing because it is the very connection with others that is the ticket to recovery.\n\nWe talk about this extensively in our therapy groups. One example comes to mind. For instance, if you read all the self-help books in the world staying in an enclosed room, would you find healing? You would know a lot more, and you could say you were more prepared to take on the work ahead, but you would not experience substantive recovery.\n\nYou *cannot* heal in isolation. You cannot be your \"true self\" in isolation either. Even though you were hurt by other people, the only way to recover is being in relation with others. ",

Remind yourself that abuse is an inescapable event that often, but not always, overwhelms people\u2019s coping mechanisms. And the consequence of abuse can last indefinitely \u2014 years, if not decades, later. Trauma does not necessarily fade with time. \n\nThis book is for the readers who responded affirmatively to the question, \u201cWere you abused as a child?\u201d This is a *subjective* approach, which is vastly different from having met the criteria for an *operational* definition of abuse. The same delineation can be made about the term trauma as well. Remember this: abuse was something *done to you* \u2014 it is not part of who you are. A \u201ctraumatic event\u201d is personal and open to interpretation. And the only expert at the end of the day is you. ",

They further hold responsibility for the climate of the group: when to dig deeper, when to shift focus, when to engage other individuals to ensure that \"talk time\" is shared and respectful. Almost all groups have guidelines around conduct. It is the therapist's job (not the group members) to ensure the group maintains safety and trust for all. \n\nGroup work provides connection with others. In many ways, it is like a laboratory to try out new awarenesses, share experiences that may be unvoiced, practise new skills of expression, vulnerability and allow for normalizing \u2014 no longer seeing oneself as the only one who went through a particular experience. By con-tributing their stories, participants will view their experiences differently.\n\nGroup therapy has been referred to as \"Triple E\" treatment: it is *equivalent* to the experience of individual therapy; it is seen as clinically *effective*, and lastly it is more *economical* than individual work.\n\nThe ideal arrangement is to consider both individual and group work concurrently as it will allow you to heal in different ways. Think of therapy as being analogous to the needs of trees. Tree roots require *depth* for sustenance \u2014 they need to go deep. This is the role of individual therapy.

Often, it must address years, if not decades, of avoidance, let alone curb or replace problematic coping mechanisms. No one can guide themselves to this place of recovery as they have never been there before. Guides are an essential part of the journey.\n\nHere is where a counsellor or therapist comes into play. While they are not the only helping relationship you may employ, their role may be critical for your recovery. They may be essential in your task of acknowledging your truth, hearing your story, and helping you acquire self-compassion. This is quite the responsibility. This level of support may be beyond what a loved one can provide. It often takes a concerned, trained and empathic \"outsider\" to help you chart your way.\n\nIf you are new to the healing process, consider finding a therapist to accompany you on this journey. Apart from learning skills and awareness of what it takes to recover from past abuse, your therapist can inject elements of trust, hope, safety and security. You no longer have to travel alone. \n\nAs the therapeutic relationship deepens over time, you may experience a deep emotional connection. This connection is restorative (a type of repair work), for you to feel unconditional regard, trust and safety \u2014 and will help undo some of the harm of the unsafe relationships you experienced when you were abused.  \n\nWhen you are shopping for a therapist, you may want to consider interviewing prospective helpers to see who can work best with you. You have the right to ask them about their experience, qualifications and approaches to working with the issues. You may also want to consider the following:",

Lastly, think about your relationship with yourself and who you truly are or want to be. \n\nLet your imagination run free in this exercise. Try to envision a picture of your destination and what it would feel like to arrive. Your imagination, along with knowledge, will help get you to the finish line. Imagination allows for possibilities \u2014 it is the call of the daring. Let it become your North Star.\n\n## About Childhood Wounds\n\nThis book focuses on the *response to trauma* \u2014 the overwhelming experience that past events have had on your life. Trauma may be a new word to consider, or it may be as familiar to you as a dirty shirt. No matter. Trauma is the present-day injury from the abuse of the past. The emphasis here is on the process of *recovery* from trauma. \n\nNot everyone who has experienced childhood abuse ends up being traumatized. Remind yourself that abuse is an inescapable event that often, but not always, overwhelms people's coping mechanisms. And the consequence of abuse can last indefinitely \u2014 years, if not decades, later. Trauma does not necessarily fade with time. \n\nThis book is for the readers who responded affirmatively to the question, \"Were you abused as a child?\" This is a *subjective* approach, which is vastly different from having met the criteria for an *operational* definition of abuse. The same delineation can be made about the term trauma as well. Remember this: abuse was something *done to you* \u2014 it is not part of who you are. A \"traumatic event\" is personal and open to interpretation. And the only expert at the end of the day is you. ",

The feeling of being cut off \u2014 avoidance, numbing, and patterns of isolation. Life stuck on repeat. Living in the past. Wishing for a better future.

Perhaps now you are. \n\nAt our clinic, the average age of men seeking recovery from childhood trauma is 45 years old.

This is vastly different from being a victim of a hurricane or a car crash. At its core, childhood abuse is an act of betrayal.\n\nIn many respects, it makes \"good sense\" that many survivors are wary of trusting others \u2014 be it a new neighbour, a potential friend, a possible date \u2014 given this history. Fundamentally, if a man concludes that *people = trust = betrayal = suffering*, he will shun connection with anyone who wants to get close to him.\n\nThis is bound to cause problems because people are wired for connection. We are social beings. We are pack animals. For 99% of our time on this planet, we have eked out our existence by living in small bands, organizing ourselves to eat each day and not be eaten. We had to learn skills from each other, adapt to the norms of the group, arrange safety and protection, and get our needs met. This is how we survived as a species. This is who we are and how we are bound together. \n\nWhile someone may \"instinctively\" stay clear of other people as a reaction to betrayal, this isolation prevents healing because it is the very connection with others that is the ticket to recovery.\n\nWe talk about this extensively in our therapy groups. One example comes to mind. For instance, if you read all the self-help books in the world staying in an enclosed room, would you find healing? You would know a lot more, and you could say you were more prepared to take on the work ahead, but you would not experience substantive recovery.\n\nYou *cannot* heal in isolation. You cannot be your \"true self\" in isolation either. Even though you were hurt by other people, the only way to recover is being in relation with others. ",

          "text": "## Finding Allies On Your Journey\n\nBy now you understand that trauma recovery is no picnic. Instead, it's long haul work, fraught with complexities. Often, it must address years, if not decades, of avoidance, let alone curb or replace problematic coping mechanisms. No one can guide themselves to this place of recovery as they have never been there before. Guides are an essential part of the journey.\n\nHere is where a counsellor or therapist comes into play. While they are not the only helping relationship you may employ, their role may be critical for your recovery. They may be essential in your task of acknowledging your truth, hearing your story, and helping you acquire self-compassion. This is quite the responsibility. This level of support may be beyond what a loved one can provide. It often takes a concerned, trained and empathic \"outsider\" to help you chart your way.\n\nIf you are new to the healing process, consider finding a therapist to accompany you on this journey. Apart from learning skills and awareness of what it takes to recover from past abuse, your therapist can inject elements of trust, hope, safety and security. You no longer have to travel alone. \n\nAs the therapeutic relationship deepens over time, you may experience a deep emotional connection. This connection is restorative (a type of repair work), for you to feel unconditional regard, trust and safety \u2014 and will help undo some of the harm of the unsafe relationships you experienced when you were abused.  \n\nWhen you are shopping for a therapist, you may want to consider interviewing prospective helpers to see who can work best with you. You have the right to ask them about their experience, qualifications and approaches to working with the issues. You may also want to consider the following:",

While there is a difference between these two categories of helpers, peer-support workers share the same lived experience as the people they serve.\n\nRegardless of your helping role, your accompaniment with men who seek recovery is most welcome. Just as there are healthcare professionals who have this lived experience (me, for example), there are accomplished peer support workers that bring a good deal of self-knowledge to the situation.\n\nRegardless of your role helping men heal from their childhood wounds, please know you are providing a vital service. Men dealing with trauma have often been ignored for too long. Your work is critical to help these men live healthier and happier lives. I applaud your efforts. \n\nThis book, along with other resources written for trauma-care providers, could frame the content of individual and group sessions and be used for guidance in your work with men.

This is one of the many paradoxes required for trauma recovery. We will explore that in a bit.\n\n## Emotional Literacy\n\nAll skills require practice. Men in therapy are no exception. Twice a meeting, men in our trauma recovery groups practise deepening their emotional expression:\n\n*\"Let's hear from everyone in our opening (closing) round and 'check-in.' In a few words, tell us how you are feeling right now, at this very moment (e.g. glad, sad, mad, anxious, calm, etc.). Feelings more than thoughts.\"*\n\nThis instruction rails against the ingrained principle of responding to \"How are you?\" with a facile, socially accepted reply like, \"I'm good.\" Yet, it is on this deeper, more profound level that we must start building emotional literacy. The work of expressing emotional vulnerability is essential \u2014 a form of truth-telling you can start practising in your day-to-day life. ",

Experience working with women does not necessarily translate into the same abilities *working with men*. Ask them about their knowledge, comfort and experience working with male clients. Don't overlook this aspect of care. \n\n3. Given the longer-term nature of trauma therapy, you need to determine whether the cost is *affordable*. Some therapists and agencies offer sliding fee scales depending on the client's income. Group therapy is also an option as it is more economical than individual therapy. \n\n4. Having a therapist with whom you feel comfortable, heard and who can challenge you is also key. You may also prefer one gender or another. Its important to find the right *click.*\n\nHere is another angle to consider: group therapy. Being in a group of other folks working on recovery, particularly men, may be helpful. You may learn as much from your \"fellow travellers\" as from the group therapist (often called a *facilitator*). You will meet other people who are dealing with similar problems, share ideas, as well as exchange emotional support. ",

Not all will resonate with this short-cut terminology, despite having this history. For one thing, the term does not provide an accurate picture of who you are as a whole person.

Trauma may be a new word to consider, or it may be as familiar to you as a dirty shirt. No matter. Trauma is the present-day injury from the abuse of the past. The emphasis here is on the process of *recovery* from trauma. \n\nNot everyone who has experienced childhood abuse ends up being traumatized. Remind yourself that abuse is an inescapable event that often, but not always, overwhelms people's coping mechanisms. And the consequence of abuse can last indefinitely \u2014 years, if not decades, later. Trauma does not necessarily fade with time. \n\nThis book is for the readers who responded affirmatively to the question, \"Were you abused as a child?\" This is a *subjective* approach, which is vastly different from having met the criteria for an *operational* definition of abuse. The same delineation can be made about the term trauma as well. Remember this: abuse was something *done to you* \u2014 it is not part of who you are. A \"traumatic event\" is personal and open to interpretation. And the only expert at the end of the day is you. ",

Often, it must address years, if not decades, of avoidance, let alone curb or replace problematic coping mechanisms. No one can guide themselves to this place of recovery as they have never been there before. Guides are an essential part of the journey.\n\nHere is where a counsellor or therapist comes into play. While they are not the only helping relationship you may employ, their role may be critical for your recovery. They may be essential in your task of acknowledging your truth, hearing your story, and helping you acquire self-compassion. This is quite the responsibility. This level of support may be beyond what a loved one can provide. It often takes a concerned, trained and empathic \"outsider\" to help you chart your way.\n\nIf you are new to the healing process, consider finding a therapist to accompany you on this journey. Apart from learning skills and awareness of what it takes to recover from past abuse, your therapist can inject elements of trust, hope, safety and security. You no longer have to travel alone. \n\nAs the therapeutic relationship deepens over time, you may experience a deep emotional connection. This connection is restorative (a type of repair work), for you to feel unconditional regard, trust and safety \u2014 and will help undo some of the harm of the unsafe relationships you experienced when you were abused.  \n\nWhen you are shopping for a therapist, you may want to consider interviewing prospective helpers to see who can work best with you. You have the right to ask them about their experience, qualifications and approaches to working with the issues. You may also want to consider the following:",

You may want to take breaks periodically when reading this book. When you do, take a look behind you to see how far you have come. Feel good about your progress. Revisit those steps with fresh eyes. \n\nEach chapter in Men's Road to Healing also contains key questions for your further reflection.

Lastly, at the end of the book, you will find references for each chapter and recommendations for further reading. \n\n## A Note About Language\n\nAs this book is aimed at *male-identified individuals*, I will make frequent use of the terms *boys, male youth* and *men*. Of course, there is a myriad of gender and sexual identities. The intent is not to limit or exclude any individual who has experienced woundedness from childhood. As gender plays a core role in who we all are, it impacts not only the immediate experience of the abuse but how such injuries are later expressed. One's gender identity is also critical in how to chart the healing journey. All that said, if this book can speak to you, let it. \n\nMen's \"significant others,\" wives, husbands, lovers, are all referenced in the book by the singular term of \"partner.\" Of course, a man may have more than one such person in their life, and no slight is intended. \n\nAs a male-identified person, I will occasionally include myself in the notion of \"we as men,\" referring to a shared connection, a men's circle, the male condition. I want to share that I am a survivor of childhood sexual abuse as well. However, this book is not about me, and I won't be sharing my own story of wounding and recovery. ",

Experience working with women does not necessarily translate into the same abilities *working with men*. Ask them about their knowledge, comfort and experience working with male clients. Don't overlook this aspect of care. \n\n3. Given the longer-term nature of trauma therapy, you need to determine whether the cost is *affordable*. Some therapists and agencies offer sliding fee scales depending on the client's income. Group therapy is also an option as it is more economical than individual therapy. \n\n4. Having a therapist with whom you feel comfortable, heard and who can challenge you is also key. You may also prefer one gender or another. Its important to find the right *click.*\n\nHere is another angle to consider: group therapy. Being in a group of other folks working on recovery, particularly men, may be helpful. You may learn as much from your \"fellow travellers\" as from the group therapist (often called a *facilitator*). You will meet other people who are dealing with similar problems, share ideas, as well as exchange emotional support. ",

Often, it must address years, if not decades, of avoidance, let alone curb or replace problematic coping mechanisms. No one can guide themselves to this place of recovery as they have never been there before. Guides are an essential part of the journey.\n\nHere is where a counsellor or therapist comes into play. While they are not the only helping relationship you may employ, their role may be critical for your recovery. They may be essential in your task of acknowledging your truth, hearing your story, and helping you acquire self-compassion. This is quite the responsibility. This level of support may be beyond what a loved one can provide. It often takes a concerned, trained and empathic \"outsider\" to help you chart your way.\n\nIf you are new to the healing process, consider finding a therapist to accompany you on this journey. Apart from learning skills and awareness of what it takes to recover from past abuse, your therapist can inject elements of trust, hope, safety and security. You no longer have to travel alone. \n\nAs the therapeutic relationship deepens over time, you may experience a deep emotional connection. This connection is restorative (a type of repair work), for you to feel unconditional regard, trust and safety \u2014 and will help undo some of the harm of the unsafe relationships you experienced when you were abused.  \n\nWhen you are shopping for a therapist, you may want to consider interviewing prospective helpers to see who can work best with you.

This section will provide some practical tips on how to communicate with greater awareness, ability and integrity \u2014 something men and trauma survivors often have trouble doing.  \n\nMany men have ingrained patterns of communication in which their real needs are often unmet in relationships. In part, this is due to stoicism and self-sacrifice \u2014 endemic traits in modern masculinity (themes that will be explored in the next chapter). Survivors of trauma often protect themselves against vulnerability and connection as well. Their personal needs  often have been overridden by other people's needs, which creates confusion, conflict avoidance and/or an unwillingness to allow for vulnerability with others, resulting in a no-win situation for all. \n\nThat said, trouble may follow whenever the individual focuses solely on his own needs (which may be interpreted as aggressive), ignoring his own needs (being passive), or ignoring the needs of both (creating a passive-aggressive dynamic). These patterns could prove harmful to his relationships, including how he generally interacts with everyone \u2014 in sum, his relational self. Many men need to be reminded about the strength and clarity of assertiveness, whereby both one's own needs and the other person's needs can be respected. \n\nThe principle of assertiveness can help you to stand up for your rights and needs while respecting the rights and needs of others.

This is vastly different from being a victim of a hurricane or a car crash. At its core, childhood abuse is an act of betrayal.\n\nIn many respects, it makes \"good sense\" that many survivors are wary of trusting others \u2014 be it a new neighbour, a potential friend, a possible date \u2014 given this history. Fundamentally, if a man concludes that *people = trust = betrayal = suffering*, he will shun connection with anyone who wants to get close to him.\n\nThis is bound to cause problems because people are wired for connection. We are social beings. We are pack animals. For 99% of our time on this planet, we have eked out our existence by living in small bands, organizing ourselves to eat each day and not be eaten. We had to learn skills from each other, adapt to the norms of the group, arrange safety and protection, and get our needs met. This is how we survived as a species. This is who we are and how we are bound together. \n\nWhile someone may \"instinctively\" stay clear of other people as a reaction to betrayal, this isolation prevents healing because it is the very connection with others that is the ticket to recovery.\n\nWe talk about this extensively in our therapy groups. One example comes to mind. For instance, if you read all the self-help books in the world staying in an enclosed room, would you find healing? You would know a lot more, and you could say you were more prepared to take on the work ahead, but you would not experience substantive recovery.\n\nYou *cannot* heal in isolation. You cannot be your \"true self\" in isolation either. Even though you were hurt by other people, the only way to recover is being in relation with others. ",

It doesn't help that men, let alone society, don't often seek open discussions on men's mental health. Men, more often than not, just don't want to talk about it. \n\nI want you to consider a term that may be new to you: trauma load. A trauma load refers to your accumulated wounds from childhood, as well as adult experiences of being wounded, including experiences that are known as *revictimization*.\n\nYour trauma load isn't as simple as counting the number of times you were abused. Sometimes, a man who was abused once by someone who be-trayed his trust may experience a heavier trauma load and may have more problems than a man who was repeatedly abused by an acquaintance. \n\nPeople are different. Trauma is tricky.\n\nResearch has shown that many factors can affect the extent of trauma in a man's life:",

The feeling of being cut off \u2014 avoidance, numbing, and patterns of isolation. Life stuck on repeat. Living in the past. Wishing for a better future. A tenuous connection to the here-and-now.\n\nToday may be the day you start to change that. Don't feel bad that you didn't do it yesterday. Perhaps you just weren't ready then. Perhaps now you are. \n\nAt our clinic, the average age of men seeking recovery from childhood trauma is 45 years old. Given that the average age of childhood sexual abuse for boys is between nine and ten years old, men are often waiting decades before they ask for help.

Trauma may be a new word to consider, or it may be as familiar to you as a dirty shirt. No matter. Trauma is the present-day injury from the abuse of the past. The emphasis here is on the process of *recovery* from trauma. \n\nNot everyone who has experienced childhood abuse ends up being traumatized. Remind yourself that abuse is an inescapable event that often, but not always, overwhelms people's coping mechanisms. And the consequence of abuse can last indefinitely \u2014 years, if not decades, later. Trauma does not necessarily fade with time. \n\nThis book is for the readers who responded affirmatively to the question, \"Were you abused as a child?\" This is a *subjective* approach, which is vastly different from having met the criteria for an *operational* definition of abuse. The same delineation can be made about the term trauma as well. Remember this: abuse was something *done to you* \u2014 it is not part of who you are. A \"traumatic event\" is personal and open to interpretation. And the only expert at the end of the day is you. ",

          "text": "*Suppose your goals for recovery were met tonight as you slept. How would your life be different when you awoke?*\n\nLet your imagination run free in this exercise. Try to envision a picture of your destination and what it would feel like to arrive. Your imagination, along with knowledge, will get you to the finish line. Imagination allows for possibilities \u2014 it is the call of the daring. Let it become your North Star.\n\n## About Childhood Wounds\n\nThis book focuses on the *response to trauma* \u2014 the overwhelming experience that past events have had on your life. Trauma may be a new word to consider, or it may be as familiar to you as a dirty shirt. No matter. Trauma is the present-day injury from the abuse of the past. The emphasis here is on the process of recovery from trauma. \n\nNot everyone who has experienced childhood abuse ends up being traumatized. Remind yourself that abuse is an inescapable event that often, but not always, overwhelms people\u2019s coping mechanisms. And the consequence of abuse can last indefinitely \u2014 years, if not decades, later. Trauma does not necessarily fade with time. \n\nThis book is for the readers who responded affirmatively to the question, \u201cWere you abused as a child?\u201d This is a *subjective* approach, which is vastly different from having met the criteria for an *operational* definition of abuse. The same delineation can be made about the term trauma as well. Remember this: abuse was something *done to you* \u2014 it is not part of who you are. A \u201ctraumatic event\u201d is personal and open to interpretation. And the only expert at the end of the day is you. ",

As no one knows how many men have been harmed as children, let alone how to define it, it will be up to you to decide about your own life. \n\n## Trauma Loads and More\n\nMany male survivors want to understand why they feel the way they do and how this compares to the experiences of other men. It doesn\u2019t help that men, let alone society, don\u2019t often seek open discussions on men\u2019s mental health. Men, more often than not, just don\u2019t want to talk about it. \n\nI want you to consider a term that may be new to you: trauma load. A trauma load refers to your accumulated wounds from childhood, as well as adult experiences of being wounded, including experiences that are known as *revictimization*. \n\nYour trauma load isn\u2019t as simple as counting the number of times you were abused. Sometimes, a man who was abused once by someone who be-trayed his trust may experience a heavier trauma load and may have more problems than a man who was repeatedly abused by an acquaintance. \n\nPeople are different.

Review the following key concepts introduced in this chapter, and if appropriate, note any reflections or examples that come to mind on the following: *holding space, \"true\" emotional expression, assertiveness, \"fighting fairly,\" emotional integrity, emotional granularity, relationships of significance, the three causalities of trauma (i.e., truth, voice, self-compassion), finding allies.*\n2. What were the messages you told yourself about the abuse? \n3. What kept you silent about the abuse? You may wish to reflect on how old you were when you disclosed the abuse. What did you do to break this silence? Who did you tell? What were the qualities of this connection that allowed you to disclose eventually? If you haven't told anyone about the abuse, what might be holding you back from doing so?\n\n## Fellow Traveller Quotes\n\n*I never could talk about it in the past. Instead, I would keep it a secret, or tear up when I saw an intervention on a TV show. Now I know I wasn't facing my past. Now that I can talk about it more comfortably, I believe healing is happening now.*\n\n*always seem to say things like \"what happened to me\" or \"the stuff I went through.\" I have a really hard time with the terminology. Back then he called it \"playing around.\" That's why it seemed, on some level, acceptable.*",

          "text": "I invite you to think about different aspects of yourself \u2014 from your physical body, to your thoughts, feelings, behaviours, habitual or problematic patterns, and your relationships with others. Lastly, think about your relationship with yourself and who you truly are or want to be. \n\nLet your imagination run free in this exercise. Try to envision a picture of your destination and what it would feel like to arrive. Your imagination, along with knowledge, will help get you to the finish line. Imagination allows for possibilities \u2014 it is the call of the daring. Let it become your North Star.\n\n## About Childhood Wounds\n\nThis book focuses on the *response to trauma* \u2014 the overwhelming experience that past events have had on your life. Trauma may be a new word to consider, or it may be as familiar to you as a dirty shirt. No matter. Trauma is the present-day injury from the abuse of the past. The emphasis here is on the process of *recovery* from trauma. \n\nNot everyone who has experienced childhood abuse ends up being traumatized. Remind yourself that abuse is an inescapable event that often, but not always, overwhelms people's coping mechanisms. And the consequence of abuse can last indefinitely \u2014 years, if not decades, later. Trauma does not necessarily fade with time. \n\nThis book is for the readers who responded affirmatively to the question, \"Were you abused as a child?\" This is a *subjective* approach, which is vastly different from having met the criteria for an *operational* definition of abuse. The same delineation can be made about the term trauma as well. Remember this: abuse was something *done to you* \u2014 it is not part of who you are. A \"traumatic event\" is personal and open to interpretation. And the only expert at the end of the day is you. ",

It is estimated that about *one in six males* experience \u201ccontact\u201d sexual abuse by age 18. This figure is an average of many North American research studies. Contact sexual abuse means abuse that involves touch between the victim and the person(s) who offended them. Children and youth can also experience sexual abuse that does not involve touch, such as exposure to pornography or a parent purposely disrobing themselves for sexual arousal. If these other noncontact forms of sexual abuse were included in this research, higher overall rates would be found. ",

          "text": "## Emotional Compression\n\nStudies have shown that women have greater emotional awareness and a larger emotional lexicon than men. Researchers are unsure as to the reasons for this difference \u2014 a matter of brain wiring or socialization or both. Whereas femininity connotes being in relationship with others, masculinity suggests individualism and invulnerability. \n\nMen tend to display less emotional depth in communication, perhaps relying on women to do more of the \"emotional work.\" The advent of boys' puberty marks the beginning of constricted emotional expression between male friends. Overall, males' emotional and social richness tends to atrophy. Their range of emotional granularity (i.e., precise emotional articulation) also diminishes. \n\nBefore proceeding, let's continue to explore why we have emotions in the first place. Emotions serve as an \"early warning system\" \u2014 a way of protecting oneself physically (fear in the face of danger), interpersonally (anger reflecting a violation of boundaries) as well as strengthening emotional intimacy (guilt signals a breach of connection with others). With every emotion, there is a powerful feedback loop to ourselves and others. \n\n*Affective numbing* describes a lack of emotional awareness and expression for many men who experienced abuse as a child. It is a symptom of trauma and manifests as an inability to sense or speak about one's emotions. Affective numbing constrains many men, not only those who have been abused. \n\n*Alexithymia* is similar. Individuals with alexithymia experience emotions but have a hard time naming and expressing them. Instead, when asked about their emotions, they may describe physical symptoms or relay the events of their day instead. A somewhat  related concept is *anhedonia* \u2014 the inability to feel pleasure. While these conditions may not be directly related to a trauma response, they are experiences found most often in men.",

It is estimated that about *one in six males* experiences \"contact\" sexual abuse by age 18. This figure is an average of many North American research studies. Contact sexual abuse means abuse that involves touch between the victim and the person(s) who offended them.

For a myriad of reasons, it is believed that abuse by females is harder for boys to identify than abuse by males. This will be examined in detail later in the book. \n\nWhile *physical abuse* is more common than sexual abuse, even less is known about how many men are affected by it. In part, it is hard for researchers to come to a consensus on what constitutes physical abuse and what does not. Physical punishment of children is still considered lawful in many jurisdictions around the world. Estimates suggest that one in four men have experienced *significant* physical abuse as children.\n\nThere is also a great deal of uncertainty with regard to the prevalence of other forms of childhood harm, from witnessing family violence to experiencing emotional abuse, neglect and chronic bullying. As no one knows how many men have been harmed as children, or how to define it, it will be up to you to decide about your own life. ",

A mental health professional may use the terms *Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Complex PTSD*, or some other label; yet you are the one who truly knows. Childhood wounds can be experienced physically, sexually, or emotionally, and can include issues of neglect, coercion and bullying. These wounds are considered developmental trauma, as they interfere with the child\u2019s psychosocial development and they may persist into adulthood. \n\nThere is no need to list all the examples of various types of childhood abuse as no one finds themselves in lists (there are many sources for types of victimization, if that is a particular learning need). As a reader, you no doubt know much of your own story.

It is estimated that about *one in six males* experience \u201ccontact\u201d sexual abuse by age 18. This figure is an average of many North American research studies. Contact sexual abuse means abuse that involves touch between the victim and the person(s) who offended them. Children and youth can also experience sexual abuse that does not involve touch, such as exposure to pornography or a parent purposely disrobing themselves for sexual arousal. If these other noncontact forms of sexual abuse were included in this research, higher overall rates would be found. ",

Although many would not admit to it, men suffer. \n\n## Invulnerability As A Given\n\nIf the Male Code was distilled into one word, it would be *invulnerable*. Of course, invulnerable people (of whatever gender) cannot, by definition, be victimized. So, when a male is victimized, he faces an impossible position \u2014 identify with masculinity (and thus deny the victimization occurred) or acknowledge the harm done and face the perceived failure of not living up to the Male Code. In either case, the outcome is often unrelenting pain.  \n\nThe Male Code shapes trauma expression in ways that can be seen as conforming to its dictates: anger and rage, as well as qualities of reserve and stoicism. Indeed, the masculine ideal is self-reliance, which, as we will see in the next chapter, also happens to be a core trauma expression. \n\n## Gender Role Strain\n\nSubscribing to the Male Code causes pain and suffering for many men \u2014 this is known as *Gender Role Strain*.

Researchers are unsure as to the reasons for this difference \u2014 a matter of brain wiring or socialization or both. Whereas femininity connotes being in relationship with others, masculinity suggests individualism and invulnerability. \n\nMen tend to display less emotional depth in communication, perhaps relying on women to do more of the \"emotional work.\" The advent of boys' puberty marks the beginning of constricted emotional expression between male friends. Overall, males' emotional and social richness tends to atrophy. Their range of emotional granularity (i.e., precise emotional articulation) also diminishes. \n\nBefore proceeding, let's continue to explore why we have emotions in the first place. Emotions serve as an \"early warning system\" \u2014 a way of protecting oneself physically (fear in the face of danger), interpersonally (anger reflecting a violation of boundaries) as well as strengthening emotional intimacy (guilt signals a breach of connection with others). With every emotion, there is a powerful feedback loop to ourselves and others. \n\n*Affective numbing* describes a lack of emotional awareness and expression for many men who experienced abuse as a child. It is a symptom of trauma and manifests as an inability to sense or speak about one's emotions. Affective numbing constrains many men, not only those who have been abused. \n\n*Alexithymia* is similar. Individuals with alexithymia experience emotions but have a hard time naming and expressing them. Instead, when asked about their emotions, they may describe physical symptoms or relay the events of their day instead. A somewhat  related concept is *anhedonia* \u2014 the inability to feel pleasure. While these conditions may not be directly related to a trauma response, they are experiences found most often in men.",

          "text": "In summary, most men abused as children have suffered a \"one-two punch\" of experience. The first hit occurs to the male psyche via the harsh codification of masculinity. The second comes from the abuse itself. \n\nPast abuse typically leads to three \"pathways\" for wounded men:\n\n**1) Resignation.** You have experienced fear and vulnerability, but the world tells you that if you're scared and vulnerable, you are not a man. You resign yourself to this ambiguous state of being. You can't identify as masculine because you see yourself as \"weak.\" Emotional isolation is often a result. This could be characterized as living a \"small life\" \u2014 functioning well below one's potential. \n\n**2) Avoidance.** You think you were never abused, or believe that what happened to you did not affect you, or just made you tougher. You are not weak. You were never weak. And if anyone suggests that you are weak, you want to strike back. You can't handle other people being vulnerable either. You are the living essence of masculinity \u2014 what could be called hyper-masculinity. In fact, there is no part of you that is anything but masculine. The cost of taking on this adversarial role with the world may escape you. \n\n**3) Struggle.** You experience that same conflict of \"vulnerability versus masculinity,\" but do not resign to it. Instead, you fight the fact that you feel \"less than,\" that you feel you don't measure up to the impossible standards of gender. Similarly, you don't avoid or deny your pain. In time, you begin to question what the world is telling you about what it means to be a man \u2014 and chafe against much of the Male Code. All to say, you struggle.\n\nIf you are a man and you are reading this book in light of your own past, the third pathway, \"struggle,\" may best depict you because you are acknowledging the wounds you carry. However, you may have lived much of your life in resignation or avoidance, exhausted those pathways, and come to struggle only recently.

It doesn\u2019t help that men, let alone society, don\u2019t often seek open discussions on men\u2019s mental health.

          "text": "In essence, the male-identified person not only has to be outwardly masculine (and not feminine) but outwardly heterosexual as well. Men need to reject any qualities within themselves that could be seen as queer (e.g., being creative, \"effeminate\" in expression, certain stereotypic occupations). Projection comes next: only \"gay guys\" do that, not \"real men.\" The end result may involve scorn and shaming \u2014 active discrimination against folks who are not \"truly\" men, creating the bedrock of *homophobia* (the contempt or hatred of queer people). \n\nThere is not much allowance for individuation and self-expression in all of this, is there? Conventional masculinity suggests a stripping down of men's humanness, a constriction of the men we were meant to be and a sense that masculinity means invulnerability.\n\nThese various aspects of the Male Code may influence your understanding about emotional disclosure, your expression of pain, and your ability to ask for help. Not surprisingly, adherence to some of these codes correlates to poorer mental and physical health outcomes for men, greater danger of being a victim of violence and premature death.\n\nThe Male Code harms men in many ways, including limiting emotional expression, taking undue physical risks, overly relying on one's work identity \u2014 all to the detriment of personal well-being as well as family and community involvement.\n\nFortunately, in recent times, there's been a shift away from the rigidity of the Male Code, in part fueled by feminism, popular culture, and the rise and broader acceptance of the queer community. Still, this social progression is not uniformly witnessed across society, with many men still set in traditional and harmful ways. The rise of social commentary from ideologues encouraging a return to rigid gender roles has not helped. The growth of the \"incel movement\" \u2014 the online subculture of men who claims injustice due to their lack of romantic or sexual success is another troubling sign of women-hating. And on the school yard, the name-calling of boys still tends to be labels of girl, pussy, sissy, and fag. \n\nIt is heartening that more and more men are questioning the masculine norms they grow up with. Many men are taking on egalitarian values, a softening of set roles, more room for self-expression, greater en-gagement in their emo-tional lives, and, in particular, greater father involvement. These changes may come at some cost for individual men as they reject what is expected of them. Still, the shadow of traditional masculinity looms over many men's psyches.

A man may believe that as a husband or father he must not only put bread on the table, but must provide his family with shiny things \u2014 possibly things he never had when he was growing up. He may believe that being a good provider is paramount. By holding such a value, he may end up working so much that his relationships with his loved ones suffer. One day, he may find that his partner or children walk out on him as he has become a \"workaholic\" and neglected his family.\n\nOther consequences of Dysfunction Strain include: sexual compulsions, substance abuse, high-risk behaviour, absentee fathering, failure to share the \"emotional work\" in relationships, health problems and proneness to sexual coercion and aggression. \n\nThese three strains produce wounds that are often overlooked by society, and may go unrecognized by the individual male as it is seen as something to be expected. The cost of living with these strains is significant and includes relational discord, absent or poor fathering, risky behaviours and aggression. \n\nArguably all men, to various degrees, experience the painful shadow of masculinity. This state is not dependent of childhood abuse; rather, this is the lived reality of men in general. It's as if masculinity facilitates inadequacy, leaving many feeling empty in unfulfilling roles with consequences that may hold a similar weight like past abuse. Men may end up hurt and stifled and may cause the same pain for those around them. \n\n## The Social Construction Of Masculinity \n\nMasculinity is often measured by performance, an achievement that has only short-term effects.

Feelings more than thoughts.\"*\n\nThis instruction rails against the ingrained principle of responding to \"How are you?\" with a facile, socially accepted reply like, \"I'm good.\" Yet, it is on this deeper, more profound level that we must start building emotional literacy. The work of expressing emotional vulnerability is essential \u2014 a form of truth-telling you can start practising in your day-to-day life. ",

Frankl*\n\nFor someone with unintegrated trauma, every day may seem the same. Days marked by emotional swings, endless replays, things feeling out of control yet needing to be in control. The feeling of being cut off \u2014 avoidance, numbing, and patterns of isolation. Life stuck on repeat. Living in the past. Wishing for a better future. A tenuous connection to the here-and-now.\n\nToday may be the day you start to change that. Don't feel bad that you didn't do it yesterday. Perhaps you just weren't ready then. Perhaps now you are. \n\nAt our clinic, the average age of men seeking recovery from childhood trauma is 45 years old. Given that the average age of childhood sexual abuse for boys is between nine and ten years old, men are often waiting decades before they ask for help. That's a lot of time, much of it in suffering, much of it in silence.\n\n## Breaking Silence",

For some, this is a simple decision. For others, their relationship to the person who harmed them is complex, nuanced, filled with ambivalence or even loving regard. \n\nWhat name do you want to give to the person(s) who harmed you? Your call.\n\n## A Note To Loved Ones\n\nTo be a survivor of childhood trauma can be a hellish experience. To be a partner or loved one to a survivor can be hellish too.\n\nI am always surprised by how many callers to our clinic are from those who are concerned about the men in their lives. Partners, parents, siblings, even employers have called asking how they can get someone into therapy. The answer is simple: he must want to do the work himself.",

Frankl*\n\nFor someone with unintegrated trauma, every day may seem the same. Days marked by emotional swings, endless replays, things feeling out of control yet needing to be in control. The feeling of being cut off \u2014 avoidance, numbing, and patterns of isolation. Life stuck on repeat. Living in the past. Wishing for a better future. A tenuous connection to the here-and-now.\n\nToday may be the day you start to change that. Don't feel bad that you didn't do it yesterday. Perhaps you just weren't ready then. Perhaps now you are. \n\nAt our clinic, the average age of men seeking recovery from childhood trauma is 45 years old. Given that the average age of childhood sexual abuse for boys is between nine and ten years old, men are often waiting decades before they ask for help. That's a lot of time, much of it in suffering, much of it in silence.\n\n## Breaking Silence",

          "text": "Specific populations of males are known to have higher rates of sexual abuse. Research suggests that Indigenous men, Queer men (i.e., gay and bisexual men and trans folks), men who have been incarcerated, and men with disabilities are known to experience higher rates of childhood abuse. There is still much to learn about who is impacted by this issue and to what degree. \n\nBoys are also at greater risk of sexual abuse if they are living with neither or only one parent, those whose parents are separated, divorced, and/or remarried, and those whose parents abuse substances and/or are involved in criminal behaviour.\n\nOne of the challenges for researchers is that children, especially males, will generally not acknowledge that they were abused. In one study, only 16% of 30-year-old men with documented histories of childhood sexual abuse considered themselves to have been sexually abused, compared to 64% of their female counterparts. As a result, male sexual abuse is commonly underestimated. \n\nOn average, boys experience sexual abuse between the ages of nine and ten. The age range at which boys are first abused, however, is from infancy to late adolescence. Some patterns of abuse may last into adulthood. Boys who experience contact sexual abuse are subjected to acts ranging from fondling to anal rape. Multiple incidents and perpetrators are not uncommon. \n\nThose who sexually offend boys and male youth are most likely people in a position of trust outside the immediate family. They can include extended family members, family friends, peers, and strangers, as well as parents and siblings. While most perpetrators of males are male, females are believed to offend in about 40% of cases. For a myriad of reasons, it is believed that abuse by females is harder for boys to identify than abuse by males. This will be examined in detail later in the book. \n\nWhile *physical abuse* is more common than sexual abuse, even less is known about how many men are affected by it. In part, it is hard for researchers to come to a consensus on what constitutes physical abuse and what does not. Physical punishment of children is still considered lawful in many jurisdictions around the world. Estimates suggest that one in four men have experienced *significant* physical abuse as children.",

As no one knows how many men have been harmed as children, or how to define it, it will be up to you to decide about your own life. ",
