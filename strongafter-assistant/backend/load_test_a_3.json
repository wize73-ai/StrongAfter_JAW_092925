      "excerpt_summary": "Starting your healing journey often begins with the brave act of acknowledging your past and understanding its profound impact. A crucial first step involves a personal process of recognizing the reality of your experiences. Many find it empowering to\n> *Write down the words, \u201cI was abused.\u201d*\n> *Say these words aloud to yourself.* \u207d\u00b9\u207e\u207d\u00b2\u207e\nThis personal affirmation is a foundational moment in making sense of your emotional and psychological landscape, which is central to *Understanding Abuse*. It marks the beginning of processing the *Common Effects of Abuse*, as survivors often carry deep emotional, psychological, and even physical wounds \u207d\u00b3\u207e. This initial, private acknowledgment is a significant step towards *Reporting Abuse*, as it enables you to begin building your story and considering how and when you might choose to share it with others in safe, trusted relationships \u207d\u00b9\u207e\u207d\u00b2\u207e.\n\nAs you embark on this path, it's vital to recognize the nature of the trauma you've experienced. *What Is Sexual Abuse* encompasses any unwanted or non-consensual sexual act, and childhood wounds, including sexual abuse, are considered developmental trauma that can profoundly interfere with psychosocial development and persist into adulthood \u207d\u00b3\u207e. You may experience these deep impacts as *Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Complex PTSD*, or other labels, but ultimately,\n> *You may have a sense of the wounds you carry. A mental health professional may use the terms Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Complex PTSD, or some other label; yet you are the one who truly knows.* \u207d\u00b3\u207e\nThis insight emphasizes that your personal understanding of your journey is paramount. The lasting effects can be so profound that, as one fellow traveler expressed,\n> *It is a process. I feel as if I literally have to start from the beginning and discover who I am. Given my past, it\u2019s not a surprise. - Fellow Traveller* \u207d\u00b3\u207e\nThis sentiment highlights how abuse can deeply complicate one's sense of self and identity, potentially intersecting with aspects like *Sexual Orientation and Identity*, as you work to rediscover and redefine who you are outside of the trauma. Trusting your inner wisdom about your story and deciding when and how to share it are empowering steps in your healing.\n\n## References\n\u207d1\u207e Unknown Author. *MR2H Chapter 1 A Couple of Things You Ought to Know*.
