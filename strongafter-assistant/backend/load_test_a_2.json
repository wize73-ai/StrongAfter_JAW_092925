      "excerpt_summary": "Beginning your healing journey often starts with the courageous act of acknowledging your past. It takes immense strength to confront the words, and a powerful first step involves both writing and speaking them aloud to yourself:\n> *Write down the words, \"I was abused.\" Say these words aloud to yourself.* \u207d\u00b9\u207e\u207d\u00b2\u207e\nThis profound act marks the beginning of making sense of your experience and understanding its deep impact. As you begin to articulate your story, it's important to recognize that your internal knowledge of the \"wounds you carry\" is paramount \u207d\u00b3\u207e. While mental health professionals may use terms like *Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)* or *Complex PTSD*, ultimately, \"you are the one who truly knows\" your story \u207d\u00b3\u207e. These experiences, especially childhood wounds\u2014whether physical, sexual, or emotional, including neglect or bullying\u2014are considered developmental trauma because they can profoundly interfere with psychosocial development and persist into adulthood \u207d\u00b3\u207e. This understanding helps to illuminate the nature of what you've endured, connecting directly to the themes of *Understanding Abuse* and the *Common Effects of Abuse*.\n\nThis process of acknowledging and understanding is not a swift destination, but a journey of rediscovery, as one fellow traveler wisely noted:\n> *It is a process. I feel as if I literally have to start from the beginning and discover who I am. Given my past, it\u2019s not a surprise.* \u207d\u00b3\u207e\nTaking time to write down the key elements of your story, perhaps in a journal, can be a foundational practice to explore these persistent *Common Effects* \u207d\u00b9\u207e\u207d\u00b2\u207e. As you feel ready, sharing parts of your story, even anonymously in supportive online groups or with trusted friends, partners, family, or a therapist, can be a crucial step \u207d\u00b9\u207e\u207d\u00b2\u207e. This act of disclosure, while deeply personal and requiring safety and trust, touches upon the broader theme of *Reporting Abuse*\u2014not necessarily in a legal sense, but in breaking the silence and seeking validation and support. It allows you to be witnessed in your truth, fostering connections that can profoundly aid your healing.\n\n## References\n\u207d1\u207e Unknown Author. *MR2H Chapter 1 A Couple of Things You Ought to Know*.
