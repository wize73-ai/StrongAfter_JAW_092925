- **Rationale**: Immediate user feedback provides highest perceived performance gain
- **Implications**: 70-90% perceived latency reduction with minimal infrastructure changes

**ADR-003: Citation Format Standards**
- **Decision**: Upgrade to Unicode superscript footnotes (¹ ² ³)
- **Rationale**: Professional academic presentation, improved readability
- **Implications**: Enhanced trust and credibility for therapeutic recommendations

**ADR-004: Hybrid Safety Routing**
- **Decision**: Config-driven safety term detection with quality-first escalation
- **Rationale**: Sensitive trauma content requires enhanced processing attention
- **Implications**: Crisis-appropriate responses while maintaining performance for general queries

### Strategic Framework: "Adaptive Depth"
- **Local First**: Mathematical/deterministic processing for simple, high-confidence inputs
- **Cloud Nuance**: LLM engagement for semantic understanding and empathetic synthesis
- **Honesty Over Hallucination**: Threshold-based evidence validation prevents false citations
- **Config-Driven**: YAML-based thresholds enable rapid production tuning

## 4. Preservation of Purpose & Nuance

### Therapeutic Standards Maintained

**Purpose Definition**: Supportive, trauma-aware assistance that provides evidence-based resources while maintaining professional boundaries and crisis-appropriate responses.

**Nuance Definition**: Empathetic communication tone, non-diagnostic therapeutic language, evidence honesty, and safety escalation for crisis content.

### Quality Preservation Mechanisms

**Empathy Rubric**: Systematic quality assessment ensuring supportive, trauma-informed language
- Temperature settings (0.3-0.4) for focused therapeutic tone
- Multi-criteria scoring validates therapeutic appropriateness
- QualityAssuranceAgent provides systematic response assessment

**Safety Triggers**: Enhanced crisis content detection
- Expanded safety terms: "self harm", "suicide", "abuse", "violence", "assault", "emergency"
- Automatic quality-first routing for sensitive content
- Crisis-appropriate response handling with enhanced processing attention

**Evidence Honesty**: Citation validation prevents hallucinated references
- Minimum cosine similarity threshold (0.30) for citation inclusion
- Threshold-based validation ensures only substantiated citations appear
- Graceful handling when no citations meet evidence standards

**Professional Boundaries**: Maintained specialization messaging
- Identical trauma vs non-trauma content filtering
- Professional specialization focus preserved
- Enhanced contextual responses for non-trauma inputs

### Example Preservation Evidence

**Before (Original)**: "Based on research from multiple sources, trauma recovery involves several key stages including..."

**After (Enhanced)**: "Living with unintegrated trauma means experiencing the past as a present-day injury ¹. Research shows that trauma manifests through various responses, including dissociation and hyperarousal ²."

**Risk Controls**:
- Hard timeouts (2-4s) prevent hanging responses
- Graceful fallback summaries for LLM failures
- Minimum quality thresholds (0.7) ensure response standards
- Agent-level error handling maintains system stability
